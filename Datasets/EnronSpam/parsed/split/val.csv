i ' m not sure who was going to handle this project - tom moore or laine
borgman . so , by this e - mail , i will ask the appropriate person to respond to
you . i have also given tom ' s name and e - mail address to ms . geman .
they will just need to change in article 17 of the software license agreement
the response time from 2 to 3 days and the software license part should be
done . the only thing that would leave then is ms . geman ' s response regarding
the escrow agreement as to whether it was agreeable to her and her law firm
( who would be holding the source code in escrow ) . i ' m not sure whether ms .
geman has responded to tom about that or not . i have sent electronic copies
of all of the documents to both tom and laine to finalize once ms . geman
responded .

ms . geman ,
i apologize for the delay , but i finally have drafted an escrow agreement for
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys . please review and have
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable .
i will be leaving the department i have been working in and moving to a
different enron subsidiary on october 13 . if at all possible , could we try
to get the software license agreement and the escrow agreement wrapped up
before i leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where i
left off ?
i think we are just about in agreement on the software license portion .
seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days . i do not have any
answers regarding that - maybe vince kaminski or stinson gibner can respond
on this issue .
i look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within
the next 2 weeks if possible .

enroncredit . com is working on 3 main models - - - the fmc model , the placement
model , and the movement model .
fmc model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33
industry offsets . each day , this model takes the previous day ' s trader
curves and adjusts them for the movement in bloomberg yields and observed
swap prices .
placement model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using
dummified ranges for market capitalization , liquidity , kmv score , etc . one
main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade
names . alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for
separate sunsets of names .
movement model : provides an alert system for news . this is under
development .
current involvement of houston research group members is in the
development / modifications of the placement model , especially in thinking
through the various single vs multi model approaches . we can help in the
brainstorming for better models for subsets . one main project right now is
to get a separate model for subsidiaries , and to exclude subsidiary names
from the main regression .
value - at - risk is based on historical variance - covariance approach .
the portfolio model is under development .
agenda for houston research group members :
once sufficient data is collected , start reviewing for potential analytic
relationships .
get weekly updates from london , and provide feedback .
plan on a trip if the work warrants it , once the agenda is fairly well drawn
out , and data is available for analysis .",0

capacity marketing - tw sold 35 , 000 mmbtu / d of firm transport to sempra energy trading at a negotiated rate of $ 0 . 50 / mmbtu plus fuel for the two year period beginning january 1 , 2004 . the path is from blanco to socal needles ; contract value is $ 12 . 8 mm . in addition , sempra waived its right to utilize its call option for 21 , 500 mmbtu / d of capacity at $ 0 . 30 / mmbtu during this two - year period .
tw also sold 14 , 000 mmbtu / d of firm transport to calpine for two years beginning jan . 1 , 2004 at a floating rate based on the difference between the california border and the san juan blanco indices . the primary delivery point is calpine ' s newly constructed power plant on the topock lateral . the floating price can currently be hedged to yield a gross margin of $ 0 . 80 / mmbtu , with a contract value ( net of fuel ) of $ 6 . 1 mm .
bp / amoco was one of several interested parties last week as tw marketed the remaining large blocks of our east capacity . bp has come back to tw with an offer , based on available space , of $ 0 . 02 / mmbtu for demand plus a sharing mechanism for alternate deliveries west . the proposed term is for 2001 april - october . we are working with facility planning to determine the available space .
gas inventory - tw continued to experience high line pressure and pack out west this week . this necessitated an additional sale of line pack gas of 15 , 000 mmbtu for a gross revenue of $ 277 , 500 .
el paso natural gas co . - bids were due monday ( 2 / 12 ) for the 1 . 2 bcf / d of west capacity on el paso . they marketed the space in 5 blocks of various capacities ; minimum bid was 100 % of the max california reservation rate for a minimum term of 1 month . market intelligence indicates over 144 bids were submitted for max terms of 5 years . el paso indicated the award announcement will be made the week of 2 / 19 . el paso merchant will likely exercise their rofr right and take the space at max rates for 5 years .",0

rick - you had asked a while back for a matrix that captures all of the

"Subject: book - split update 4 / 25 / 2000
as we are nearing the deadline for the book - split project , i want to give you
a status update .
book - split
completed
separate cash & term books have been setup in enpower and global databases
for every country
pablo pissanetzky has written code to successfully transfer over 99 % of the
deals into their proper regional books
two dozen deals ( mainly annuities ) have been modified in production to
transfer according to pablo ' s code
all deals requiring manual intervention on go live date have been identified
initial position report has been developed and tested for accuracy
uncompleted
communication to commercial of positions ( wed . april 26 )
presentation of the position report which allows commercial to view monthly
peak / off - peak volumes by region ( wed . april 26 )
pcs by deal for each portfolio
separate dprs and associated reports for the pool and bilateral portfolios
modifications necessary for the settlements invoicing system
transmission
we are making progress on this effort although you have not seen any hard
evidence . zhiyong wei is the it director in houston who is responsible for
enpower development . we are working with pablo and zhiyong on several
possibilities . as we have previously discussed , there is not the current
capability to value the spreads as options , but we are testing the other
scenarios .
buy / resale
this deal type has been disabled
we are waiting for zhiyong ' s response as to its future functionality if any
transmission
pablo tested in the stage environment today after receiving minor assistance
from zhiyong
ability to book transmission deal without annuity leg
ability to liquidate demand charge daily
reflects long and short positions at the appropriate regions ( as forwards not
options )
does not value the forward spread between the regional curves ( still testing )
variable cost treatment is still being tested
forwards
if deep in the money , we could enter intra - desk / inter - desk deals to reflect
positions and p & l
much time and it development resources have been spent to make use of the
transmission functionality . after speaking with zhiyong , there evidently was
a big push last year for the mtm of transmission . the latest version has
been in the test environment for some time , but no one is currently testing
it . it will take some attention to test it properly and will not be complete
by the book - split deadline .
as we established in our last meeting , the mtm of transmission is a separate
project from the book - split . due to the complexity and amount of data
involved in the book - split project itself , it is advisable that we
incorporate the transmission second . further testing of the transmission
will continue this week and by the end of the week we should have a decision
on the most effective way to currently book transmission .
please call or come by if you have any questions ,

enron accused of infringing patent for electronic trading
marshall , texas , sept . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the
largest energy trader , and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a texas company ' s patent for an electronic
trading system .
bid / ask llc of baird , texas , formerly called auction source
llc , said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in may
2000 for a ` ` real - time network exchange with seller specified
exchange parameters and interactive seller participation . ' '
houston - based enron and its enrononline unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its internet - based
electronic trading facility , according to the lawsuit filed sept .
17 in federal court in marshall , texas . enron trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network .
bid / ask seeks a court order blocking enron from infringing
the patent , and is asking for damages .
enrononline began trading electricity and natural gas in
november 1999 . between then and the second quarter of 2001 , it ' s
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $ 685
billion , the company has said .
enron , which also trades space on fiber - optic networks , coal ,
paper and other commodities , had net income of $ 979 million on
revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .
an official with enron couldn ' t immediately be reached for
comment .

maybe knowing frevert well is enough . i am planning to come in november

to discuss

of about 60 % at our ena meeting two weeks ago . some of those unfinished
reviews were mine to give ( 16 direct reports is a killer ) . i wrote three
last night after tyler went to bed , finished at 1 : 00 am and gave all three
reviews this morning . i have 5 more to write tonight , and to deliver
tomorrow morning to be at 100 % . i will try to call you on my way into the
office tomorrow morning from the car . if i miss you then , it will be late
afternoon houston time before i could call you . next week shapes up to be
much better .
i am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations . would love

great job to all ! ! we made it from contract execution to financial close in 5 months . this success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of you and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction , including :
1 . setting an industry record for responding to a 2 nd request from the dept . of justice and securing their approval .
2 . expediting the analysis and repair of a 60 mile segment of the a / s pipeline .
3 . transitioning hpl ' s hardware and software infrastructure from enron to aep
4 . unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value of over $ 150 mm
5 . separating hpl ' s business process , work flow , from enron ( after 75 years of integrated operation )
6 . segregating property between leased and purchased facilities
7 . collecting and sorting over 14 , 000 boxes of books and records
8 . moving over 250 people from 4 different enron entities into a new location while keeping the pipeline operating .
7 . accounting for the transfer of prm assets , cwip , leased assets , purchased assets , imbalances , payables and receivables .
the transaction freed up approximately $ 725 mm of capital that enron can put to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses , but the work on hpl is not over yet . there are a number of follow up activities that we need to complete in order to maximize the value of the hpl transaction . jim coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis , including :
1 . collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with aep to resolve imbalances .
2 . closing out accounting entries for property , work orders , external accounts payable , and internal charges .
3 . eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilities .
4 . fully transitioning hpl systems , facilities , and books / records to aep .
again , thank you for your effort - and if i have inadvertently missed anyone please pass along my appreciation to them as well . we will be hosting a lunch for the enron / hpl employees who worked on the transaction on the 15 th of june at 12 : 00 in the imperial ballroom at the hyatt regency hotel . please attend if your schedule permits .

atten : ceo .
dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don ' t know me in person , but please take this mail into consideration . though , i do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in zimbabwe but it has formed consistent headlines in the cnn , bbc news bulletins , my name is david makume from zimbabwe , a country in southern africa . my father mr johnson makume , was a farmer in my country . my father was accused of sympathizing with white farmer against the wish our ruling government ( z . a . n . u . p . f ) and all their allies ( the war veteran ) they killed him . you can verify this from these international newspaper websites .
before he was killed , my father made a deposit with a security company in south africa , and he confided in me that he left some money in a diplomatic trust company in abroad , ( name withheld for security reasons ) . this money was for expansion of his farm business to other parts of southern africa .
all i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund ( sealed in diplomatic consignment ) from security company and invest in your country . when you claim the fund , i shall come over to your country with my mother and my siblings so that we can start a new life
if you may ask why do i need a foreign assistance or why can ' t i take the cash transfer and myself ? the answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my father which states unambiguously that ' nobody , not even himself , can have access to the consignment in the company , and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside africa . this was done because he envisaged danger in the crisis that continued in our country ( zimbabwe ) and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund .
my decision to contact you is therefore , informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world . i believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust i repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care . permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way . on my part , this is my assurance and guarantee to you . in as much as you follow my instructions carefully , religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch - free success remains unshakable . i have contacted the diplomatic security firm to confirm the deposit , which is worth twenty six million , five hundred thousand united state dollars only , ( $ 26 . 5 m )
you will be given 30 % of the total sum at the end of the transaction . if you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country . i want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction .
kindly include your full names , private telephone and fax numbers where you can always be reach , to enable me send some other important information across to you . this proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and confidentiality .
please reply to this
sincerely ,

as we discussed , the following is a list of diligence items that we would
like to explore further . this list is not all inclusive and we may need to
discuss additional items as we continue with due diligence . please let me
know when we could meet to discuss them further . kevin and i had
tentatively scheduled a november 28 , 2001 meeting to discuss development of
purchase and sale agreements and possibly some of the items listed below :
assuming that the megs system includes the riser and topside equipment
on marathon ' s sp 89 platform , we will need verify potential liability for
the same and any agreements addressing such access . we would also like
to review the production handling agreement between burlington / mariner
and marathon to verify the impact it may have on the future operation of
the system
we will need a definitive representation from enron as to the status of
the producers committment obligations as of december 1 , 2001 as defined
in the gathering agreements , including any credits due from prior years
excess flows . it is our understanding that for the month of december
there will be a $ 93 , 000 credit to the payment due gatherer and there are
no credits due in 2002 .
in the gathering agreement "" project payout "" is referenced from the
producer ' s joa . please provide verification that this payout has
occured , the ownership percentage is now 51 % mariner and 49 % burlington
and that there is no future change that could affect the megs agreements
need to review sample invoices , sample gas and condensate measurement
statements and demonstration of timely payment of such invoices by
producers

"Subject: wti - new eol product
please provide comments on the summary below . after i have collected them ,
we can decide to distribute to greg , john , jeff and anyone else involved .
the following is my summary of our collective thoughts regarding the proposed
24 x 7 trading of prompt wti :
1 ) appears advisable to have on - site human monitoring for the following
reasons :
a ) public relations
b ) in case there are operational bugs
c ) unforeseen market events , particulary during off exchange hours , long
weekends , etc
2 ) we advocate some live trading simulation with incentives to "" bust "" the
system prior to launch to work our
operational glitches , and because the historical simulations used daily ,
not intra - day prices .
3 ) consider a daily position limit ( a sub - limit of the overall global
products limit ) whereby each day , at least once a day ,
the open position will be reduced under the limit ( or to close to flat ? )
4 ) consider a "" trigger "" whereby the fixed spread widens if a certain number
of consecutive trades occurs on the same
side of the market
5 ) consider the purchase of deep out - of - the - money puts and calls to protect
against extreme events .

"Subject: pending ferc order , west - wide mitigation
the following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting . we are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues . generally , the order is expected to expand the scope of the commission ' s april 26 order , and this report will highlight the differences .
geographical scope - mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states .
term - the term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers . we expect the order to issue today . if so , the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9 / 30 / 02 .
spot market - defined as sales of 24 hours or less , transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery .
must sell - to prevent physical withholding , the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time . all california generators , even those not subject to ferc price regulation , will be required to sell into the iso ' s real time market . sellers in the rest of the wscc are similarly required to sell , except that they are not required to sell into california and can choose their spot market . they will be required to post available power on the western systems power pool board . hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted .
price mitigation - expanded to be in place 24 hours per day , 7 days per week . applies to all sellers , including marketers and non - public utilities . the plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market , based on marginal cost bids . the proxy price formula is changed in several respects :
1 . gas price will be the average of the mid - point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in gas daily for malin , socal gas large packages and pg & e city gate .
2 . o provided that marketers may not bid above the proxy price . ferc will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy . generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in ca if they so choose ( i . e . no cherry picking ) .
demand side management - the plan originally set forth in the april 26 order is expected be removed in this order .
iso reporting - iso will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in ca .
comments - comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes .
settlement conference - the settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than june 25 ( next monday ) and the parties will have 15 days to settle . a report from the judge to the commission is due 7 days thereafter ( for a total of 22 days ) .
issues that are not expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality , iso board issues , iso scheduling penalty application , and market based rate authorization . the order is not finally issued as of yet , and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a final order . we will keep you posted .

"Subject: re : eott options
tracy ,
attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both black - scholes and
american option valuation models . these are the generally accepted methods
for valuation of options on equity . the "" european "" option prices assume
that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity , while the
"" american "" style options can be exercised at any time during their life .
i have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market
value of $ 13 . 00 and that the options are struck at this level . the
volatility input is the other main assumption . eott has been trading
recently with a volatility ranging between 30 % to 40 % although looking
further back , the range is much wider .
to run the model , you must be linked with the options library . i am not
sure what lan you are connected with , but you can coordinate with zimin lu
( x 36388 ) for help with loading the option library add - in module . on the ena
lan it is located under o : \\ research \\ exotica \\ xll \\ exotica . xll . this is

bascially , we will need to spend another $ 7 . 5 million on 11 / 30 to keep the equipment orders alive .
the spreadsheet below may help .
the line "" incremental cash spend "" is what enron will need to pay at the end of each november and december . the line "" cancellation + e - next interest "" is enron ' s cancellation exposure ( binding commitment to the equipment vendors and e - next ) to the extent we cancel on those dates .

louise ,
cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e - next banks ( turbopark ) . the cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date . we do not need balance sheet cash to continue , but we need to come up with b / s cash if we terminate . hopefully the following clarifies :
cash payments to date :
ge 7 fa 13 , 328
st 909
hrsg 1480
interest 350
total : 16 , 067
next payments :
ge 7 fa 1 , 566 nov 21
st 2 , 849 dec 1
hrsg 2 , 960 dec 1
these are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones
cancellation charges :
10 / 31 : $ 23 mm
11 / 1 : $ 24 mm
11 / 30 : $ 28 . 3 mm
each day from 11 / 1 to 11 / 30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $ 150 k
dash is based on contractual exposure , not cash out the door , hence the request at this time . in addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project , we are looking into the st and hrsg contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach .

louise :
a termination of equipment associated with the longview project on or before 10 / 31 / 01 will require enron to write - off approximately $ 23 million , not inclusive of approximately $ 3 million in development costs to date .
to extend orders for equipment to 11 / 30 / 01 will cost an additional $ 5 . 3 million in cancellation charges .
to extend orders for equipment to 12 / 31 / 01 will cost an additional $ 8 . 7 million ( inclusive of the $ 5 . 3 million above , therefore , net $ 3 . 4 million ) in cancellation charges .
termination at any time between now and year - end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent .

as you know , technology is critical to enron ; it drives our success and will

sally ,
over the past year or so enron has made a great impact at the university of
oklahoma . in a very short time we have become one of the employers of
of choice within the college of business . we have been able to do this by
paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary . we have formed
great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to
come , if we do not become complacent . i for one am an example of the
impression
that enron has forged at ou . i am here because i believe that enron
represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry ,
but the
but the business world in general .
i am sending this note because i believe we are taking steps that will lessen
our momentum at the university of oklahoma . i have learned that we will
not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall . as you
know , last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment
after our presentations . being a student at the time i felt this was a great
idea and i know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well .
they felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from enron
representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided . as i
understand the a / a program now takes the position that this does not provide
any residual value for enron and does not warrant the expense . i do not
understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an
arrangement . it places another selling point on our presentation and gives
us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent . this
may seem like an insignificant detail , but i hope we will see the value
that this opportunity presents . the students of the em program and the j . c .
penney leadership program are expecting another exciting evening from enron
and hate to see us fall short of these expectations . it is very likely that
if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will . the competition
for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident
in our recruiting efforts . enron is a great place to work and we must take
that image to campus . i know that mr . mcconnell is a very exciting speaker
and will no doubt amaze those present . that is why we should take this
simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and
continue our path to recruiting dominance at the university of oklahoma .
i am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting ou within
enron ' s sights . your involvement at ou is greatly appreciated and i hope you
maintain
your interest in the university of oklahoma . please consider my views on
this matter and express any concerns of your own to the analyst and associate

executive summary
? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for
past utility debt
? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short
for pg & e this summer
? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy
chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs
? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions
for california
california public utility commission rate increases
today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the
department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to
consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate
hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from
consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer
advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,
but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,
which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to
securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to
sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every
day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is
essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such
as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of
finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other
programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are
issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a
recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10
billion worth of state bonds .
davis & pg & e at odds
sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult
challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer
groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,
and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the
ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to
limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the
utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars
further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would
provide davis with even less negotiating power .
with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state
legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and
state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a
special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of
price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .
davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being
picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .
qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy
sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience
and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s
qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing
against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs
and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s
senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further
investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .
out with hebert , in with wood
the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat
wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican
leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .
the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a
fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states
in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made
several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power
refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and
power plant installation .
it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal
that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions
might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well
as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in
the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and
believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering
whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as

subject : cash & reorg financial reporting
re : chapter 11 reorganization
financial reporting requirements
many people have questions regarding how enron will be operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings . this memo addresses the financial reporting requirements enron will have to its various constituents .
during the reorganization , the company will continue its gaap reporting , with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities , as well as historical management / operational reporting , consistent with past practices .
in addition , the company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents . specifically , enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis . the court and our new debtor - in - possession ( "" dip "" ) lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows . the budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections . the weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows . thus this process will be an ongoing one , with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible .
the initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the dip lenders will be willing to make available to the company . in addition , the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and dip lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at enron . however , all enron business units ( not just ones in bankruptcy ) will need to conform to these new requirements , because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire company .
the weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by mike deville ( x 57852 ) and greg adams ( x 33887 ) . in addition , enron has retained batchelder & partners , inc . , a financial advisory firm , to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts .
we will be having a group meeting with the cao ' s and / or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on wednesday , december 5 at 2 : 00 pm in the boardroom on the 50 th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have . we will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements .
attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required . please review this template in advance of the wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format . obviously the requirements may change , which will require us to reformat and / or obtain additional information on short notification .
thank you in advance for your cooperation . we look forward to your attendance on wednesday .",0

subject : please read , sign , and pass on .
though she ' s dead and has just been located , after 5 years , this lady
continues to haunt us from her shallow grave .
get this :
cbs will be forced to discontinue "" touched by an angel "" for using the word
god in every program . madeline murray o ' hare , an atheist , successfully
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few
years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the
same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,
dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .
they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is
successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a
christian can help !
we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their
effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned
about our country . as christians we must unite on this .
please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation .
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .
together we
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the lord .
please press "" forward "" , clean up the message , and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this .
now , please sign your name at the bottom ( you can only add your name after
you have pressed the "" forward "" ) .
don ' t delete any other names , just go to the next number and type your name .
please do not sign jointly , such as mr . & mrs . each person should sign
his / her own name .
please e - mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this , and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion .

subject : unify
hey ken ,
i just wanted to let you know that the financial settlement group were very
impressed with unify during the first training class that we had on friday .
i did not hear any negative comments , and they even said they liked it better
than sift . some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are :
1 . the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options
2 . the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting different
statement groups for different payment terms
3 . the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen
4 . the system is more efficient than sift
5 . the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the
line to make adjustments
6 . the ability to wire foreign currencies ( really and sap enhancement )
one thing that i did hear is that they wished they could see enron north
america and ena global together on the financial list screen .
i think the development group did a great job , and i enjoyed working with
everyone . i hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will
continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient
response to areas of concern and enhancements .
thank you to the group for all of your hard work ,
becky",0

total imports of 5 . 8 bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million
cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day ( see table 6 ) . pipeline capacity into the state
during the month ran at 83 percent utilization . so far in august , pipeline
capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate , running at 85 percent .
these high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices
in southern california , and the pressure should continue during september .
total demand in california is expected to decline somewhat during september ,
but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation
will provide support . total demand in the state should average 6 . 6 bcf per
day , down only slightly from august ' s total of 6 . 8 bcf per day . flows into
the state between august and september are not likely to change
significantly , but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand . the
topock differential to the henry hub should average approximately $ 0 . 50 per
mmbtu for september ( see table 7 ) .
storage inventories in the west are still healthy relative to levels in the
rest of the united states , but the storage surplus in the region has eroded .
in california , inventories are running lower than last year , and the deficit
in the state looks likely to widen during september . the end of injection
season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of topock
differentials to winter price spikes .
pacific northwest
malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that topock
prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the rocky mountains
and san juan basins have shown . so far this month , prices at malin are
averaging a $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu discount to the henry hub . pipeline capacity into
the region from the rocky mountains is running nearly full ; flows on pgt out
of alberta have averaged nearly 2 . 2 bcf per day this month . export capacity
out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity , and pipeline
constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving
the wide malin - to - topock differentials .
continuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong ,
and the wide north - south differentials within the west will likely hold
through september . in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb
through september to 1 . 5 bcf per day from 1 . 4 bcf per day in august . this
demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current
levels . for september cera expects malin prices to average $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu
below the henry hub price .
southwest
prices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising
california demand . although the westward pull on supplies is strong ,
bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects
between san juan prices and topock prices . pipeline capacity utilization
rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reached 93 percent
during july , with less than 200 mmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity .
increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are
contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply , and in general ,
the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices
at topock or the permian basin .
unlike in the past two summers , the bottleneck has not allowed power demand
on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices . the
differential between san juan and permian has averaged $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu so far
this month and $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu since june . additional imports from the
rockies into the san juan have increased supply by 200 mmcf per day relative
to last summer , but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect .
without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand , the san
juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september . the san
juan - to - henry hub differential is expected to average $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu . as in
the rockies , differentials should narrow substantially in october .
rocky mountains
downward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month
as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb .
record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand
within the region ; generation is still largely coal - based , and the demand
impact on gas of the additional load is minimal . cera expects the heavy
discount - current rocky mountain - to - henry hub differentials are around $ 0 . 90
per mmbtu - to persist through september . local area demand is not expected to
change during september . substantial gain in local demand comes in october
with heating loads ; october demand should average 1 . 4 bcf per day , up from
august and september averages of around 1 . 2 bcf per day .
although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the
rockies , winter differentials are expected to stay in the $ 0 . 25 to $ 0 . 40 per
mmbtu range . strong storage inventories will limit the connection with
broader north american markets this summer . next summer , pressures on rockies
supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer . although pipeline
expansion projects have been announced - trailblazer and williams announced
expansion plans this summer - the new capacity will not be online to relieve
constraints next summer . cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to
increase by 300 mmcf per day next year .
western canada
after widening to over us $ 1 . 50 per mmbtu , the aeco - henry differential has
begun to narrow somewhat ; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely
been responsible for the jump from $ 0 . 84 per mmbtu in july . with current
supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes
having to pay full cost to flow , differentials are likely to persist in the
mid - us $ 0 . 70 s per mmbtu for september . aeco is expected to be us $ 3 . 25 per
mmbtu ( c $ 4 . 53 per gigajoule ) for september . even with the start - up of the
alliance project , the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to
continue the two - tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted
pipeline costs . this will result in differentials that will range between
us $ 0 . 60 and us $ 0 . 75 per mmbtu throughout the winter .
supply build in western canada continues to languish behind last year ' s
levels . the pace of drilling ( over 9 , 000 gas wells are expected this year )
should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001 . supply is expected
to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350
mmcf per day in 2001 .
sumas prices have been quite volatile , driven by both weather in the pacific
northwest and maintenance on the westcoast system . for september , sumas is
expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to aeco
of us $ 0 . 05 per mmbtu .

subject : government affairs organization announcement
with the announcement of enron ' s acquisition by dynegy behind us , and with the initial severance process completed , it seemed an appropriate time to effect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future . before i turn to the organizational changes , i would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving the company as a result of the initial severance ( you ' ll know who they are by their absence on the organizational chart ) : leading and being a part of this group has been a privilege ? i am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the responsibility . this sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicated group of professionals and support staff and who , to a person , are also very decent and good people . to say good - bye to some of our colleagues is not easy . i want to , on behalf of all of us , thank them for their hard work , their integrity , their decency , and the good times and laughter that we shared . i trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special . thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done .
as to the organizational structure , it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization , with a mix of groups organized along functional and regional lines ( particularly within the u . s . ) , has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times . the need to rationalize the organizational structure , in order to consolidate all u . s . energy functions , is a strong need from my perspective . as a result , jim steffes will lead the u . s . energy group along with sue nord , who will jointly report to jim and myself . sue will assist jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to help jim shoulder a significant burden . also reporting to jim will be a leadership group for u . s . energy that will be as follows : wholesale electricity will be led by christi nicolay ; retail electricity and natural gas will be led by harry kingerski ; wholesale gas will be led by leslie lawner . last , but not least , jeff dasovich and sue mara , who will continue to focus on california energy issues , will report to jim . ( sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team ) .
steve montovano , who will continue to report to me , will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti .
with the elimination of the regional groups , i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political / legislative needs across the u . s . paul kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support . paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the u . s .
much of the rest of the group remains the same . linda robertson will continue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel , who reports to linda , taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc . amr ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also continue to manage the risk analytics function . maggy huson will take over support of the non - energy business units , which are as follows : global markets , industrial markets , networks , and broadband . rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada . paul dawson , who heads up government affairs for europe ; sergio assad , who heads up government affairs for south america ; and mike grimes and mark crowther , who head up our asian efforts , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself .
i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company . that committee will consist of rob hemstock , maggy huson , amr ibrahim , paul kaufman , harry kingerski , leslie lawner , steve montovano , christi nicolay , sue nord , sarah novosel , linda robertson , jim steffes and myself . we will also continue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson , harry kingerski , sue nord , linda robertson , jim steffes & myself . finally , i am forming a dynegy / enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of jose bestard , paul dawson , paul kaufman , sue nord , sarah novosel and myself .
no organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent . i believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future . however , we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company .
one final note : i am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company . we are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered , but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges , for those of us who do remain a part of the new dynegy , reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group . personally , i will do all i can , for as long as i can , to steer the group through this to the very best place possible . your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated . hang in there and thanks .",0

"Subject: option hedging for ees
eugene ,
bob and i had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday .
for an option writer , he has the obligation to deliver , so he hedges it with
the underlying by adjesting delta positions . the hedging cost , theoretically ,
should be equal to the fair value of the option premium .
on the other hand , for the option holder , he has no obligation , by delta
heging ,
he would pay double for the option , with no upside . so he should not hedge
it at all .
if the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option , he should
sell
the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta - neutral
portfolio .
this may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option
underlyings .
our question to you , if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the
ees
contracts , say fixed price sale contracts , what makes it possible to just
separate those options
and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options ? we
conjecture that these
options are meant to hedge the original contract . by selling those options
you eliminate the upside of the
original contract .
give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further .

i forgot to mention to you one other development i propose , a theory i call
"" uncoupling "" of basis . as an example , severe cold weather specific to the
midwest can result in an elevation of spot market prices at henry hub , where
prices elsewhere in the northeast are such that the basis appears to be less
than the commodity charge to ship gas from louisiana to the northeast . this
can happen when gas is not being moved in the spot market from louisiana to
the northeast at that time . the notion of "" equilibrium "" cannot , in my view ,
always assume "" spot "" gas is flowing along all nodes of the network .

great . keep in mind - some people continue to confuse "" wellhead portfolio ""
with "" deals done by producer services . "" all that should be in the wellhead
portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by greg sharp ' s
origination teams at competitive points . does that make sense ?

i worked with tom acton last night to get the wellhead portfolio cleaned up .
tom had a sheet from vance that we used to determine what deals should be in
the portfolio . i believe the portfolio is now correct . the sitara team will

"Subject: organizational changes
we are pleased to announce the following organizational changes :
enron global assets and services
in order to increase senior management focus on our international businesses , we are creating a new business unit , enron global assets and services ( egas ) . egas will be led by kevin hannon , chief executive officer , and jim hughes , chief operating officer . kevin will report to the enron corp . office of the chairman . with the exception of the wessex water company ( which will remain in the enron transportation services organization ) and enron india ( discussed below ) , egas will include all of the assets and activities of the former enron global assets group and the azurix organization . egas will include enron ' s assets and merchant activities in south america . in order to ensure continuity in the management of our south american merchant business , john lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities . john will report to kevin hannon with respect to the south american merchant business , and will continue to report to the enron wholesale services office of the chairman for all other activities in his role as chief executive officer of enron americas .
enron india
enron ' s significant interests in india are commanding increased attention from enron ' s senior management . we are pleased to announce that rebecca mcdonald will focus exclusively on enron ' s business in india , as chief executive officer of enron india , reporting to the enron corp . office of the chairman .
enron broadband services
with kevin ' s departure from enron broadband services ( ebs ) , we are also making a number of changes in the ebs organization . jim fallon will now be president and chief operating officer of ebs . paul racicot , marcello romano and fred cohagan will maintain their ebs risk management activities within their respective regions . dave cox will continue as chief commercial officer of ebs and will also join ken rice and jim fallon in the ebs office of the chairman . finally , rick fehl will continue as vice president of network engineering and chief network officer but will now report to the ebs office of the chairman .
enron principal investments
in order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to enron ' s core businesses , we are combining the existing investment groups in ena , ebs , enron investment partners and the enron special asset group into a single unit , enron principal investments . enron principal investments will work with all enron business units to identify , execute , and manage equity investments that leverage enron ' s unique and proprietary knowledge . these investments may be in the form of venture capital , leveraged buy - outs , traditional private equity and distressed debt positions . this new business unit will be headed by kevin garland , managing director , and will report to an investment committee consisting of dave delainey , ken rice , and greg whalley .

one of enron ' s most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or businesses that are no longer core operations . mark metts , executive vice president of enron corp . , will head up a new special projects group to specifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transactions .
please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new responsibilities .",0

direct private phone : + 44 7040115431
dear ,
compliments , and do please accept my highest regards and esteem . this
proposal might come to you as a surprise due to the urgent need of a
reliable foreigner , i therefore deem it necessary to contact you . i am
bernard louis mcarthy , a solicitor at law and the personal attorney to late
mr . martin chey a thai nationale residing in johannesburg south africa ,
hereinafter shall be refered to as my client . on the 22 nd of dec . 2004 , my
client , his wife and all their three
children travelled to thailand for the christmas holiday . unfortunately , my
client mr . chey and all his family died in the most terrible and highly
horrible indian ocean ' s tidal wave disaster ( asian tsunami ) of the dec . 26 th
2004 .
ever since this tragic and traumatic events , i have made frantic efforts to
establish contacts with his relatives , but could not succeed . due to the
fact that considering the nature of my clients business dealings , he never
presented any name on documentation as his possible next of
kin . i am therefore with all sense of humility decided to make contact with
you in order to assist in claiming and retrieving the money left behind by
my client before the credit house know of his demise and probably get the
funds confiscated or even decleared it unserviceable by the finance and
credit institution where these funds were deposited . i solicit your urgent
assistance and co - operation as a foreigner for easy passage of the funds to
your designated bank account .
mr . chey was a successful businessman and was involved in cash transactions
due to the nature of his business . he was engaged in buying of raw gold and
diamond from his suppliers in the mineral - rich equatorial belt of central
and southern african countries , after which he sends the consignments to
bangkok in thailand for processing and onward shipments to dubia and
saudi arabia .
the amount of money kept in the custody of the finance and credit house is
$ 45 million dollars only . since i have been unable to locate his relatives
after all my frantic efforts , i am therefore compelled by this circumstances
to seek your consent to present you sir , with my position as his legal
advicer as his next of kin or business associate of the deceased so as to
enable you receive and collect the above funds . all other further
informations to that effect at my disposal will be made available to you
upon your consent and the acceptance of the project .
the funds when retrieved and successfully secured will be shared thus :
myself , the attorney 40 % , yourself the presented next of kin 30 % , while 20 %
will go to charity and possibly the tsunami victims through you , in line
with my clients belief and support for charity as a great philantropist
during his life time , the balance of 10 % will be for contingency expenses to
be incured during the process by both parties . i assure you the fullest and
absolute co - operation and a hitch free operation in this regards . i equally
guarranttee you total protection against any breach of the law in line with
my legal profession . you are very free to ask qestions you deem necessary
for further clarifications , and please endeavour to always keep secret all
informations concering this transaction . your most urgent response will be
highly appreciated through my email : ( bernardmcarthy @ myway . com ) in order to
avoid my making further contacts .

"Subject: update
here ' s just a quick summary of what we have going on . . . ( not sure how quick
this is going to be ! )
enrononline
offering products on other exchanges ( houstonstreet and true quote ) . we are
going to offer specific products ( various gas and power products ) to
customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms .
therefore , we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new
applications built to support the interfaces . we will be responsible for
adding / deleting products , ensuring the sites match ours , reporting trades on
these systems , bridging applicable data to downstream systems , etc . enron
gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity .
opening up enrononline to brokers . we are negotiating with three brokers
right now . they will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to
the site , and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties
only . we will also need applications built and establish specific processes
to support this .
wish list - we have a list of approx . 180 times that we need the developers
to work on for us . jay webb committed to louise a few weeks back ( when i was
in her office ) that we would get a resource ( specifically chris luttrel and
his team ) . i think you are aware of this . chris is now moving on to do
something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks . we
have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the it team ( mark dilworth
and company . . . ) . basically , since mark has decided to leave the group ,
nothing is being addressed . i am going to speak to dave tomorrow about this
and escalate from there necessary . this needs a more detailed explanation -
i am going to try to get some time with you next week .
steel - i will discuss with dave tomorrow . he basically told me not to do
anything ( another topic of discussion . . . . )
we are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the pcg
louise has asked that i not allocate any of the pcg time to europe - i don ' t
agree with this because i have four people preparing the management report on
a daily basis and i have a call center that also supports europe . i tried to
argue my point but did not get very far : ) i am going to talk to dave about
it some more .
working on bridging to thunderball and the new weather application
legal / credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - credit
is improving ( they hired a new person ) , but legal has one person responsible
for new cp set up ( tana jones ) . when she is out , all application processing
stops . i am going to talk to mark taylor about appointing a back up at a
minimum . tana does a great job , but our activity is really increasing ( she
also supports clickpaper ) , so it is becoming an issue .
we have set another record today - we have already done 3 , 358 trades ! ! ! !
no new news from canada on power trading - legal needs to sign off . in mark
taylor ' s shop
argentina in the works - probably end of month .
clickpaper
we have so much , i am not sure where to start . i had lunch today with jeff
harbert to discuss what our needs were . we need tools from reporting to
credit . . .
the commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products , and
are starting to hire marketing people and traders . the activity is really
picking up
the contractors are working weekends ( call center ) . i am working the
commercial group to discontinue this . we are not even getting that many
calls during the week , and we have not received one call on sat / sun since
launch ( july )
commodity logic
dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great
resource ( i have received several compliments from the networks team on his
contribution )
they have not yet released the first module ( financial mgmt - cfo ) . should
be very soon
dealbench
no external customers - very slow developing . . . . staying involved and in
touch with the commercial team
other
i am still looking for an assistant . i sent five resumes down to staffing
and a week later the interviews were not scheduled . i went down to complain
and two of them were scheduled . a week later , the other three were yet to
be scheduled , so i am doing it myself . i think we have some real issues in
the staffing group - this is not the first time .
we are working on disaster recovery for the group .
super saturday - i would like our team to participate . do you have an idea
of who all is interviewing ? we would like to be involved .
we are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage
i talked to mary sloan ( sap ) and keith clark ( call center ) is working with
her . i think she really appreciates the help / input .
have you had a chance to review the announcement letter re : reorg ?
sorry for the long - winded message . . . .

a press release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "" netcoonline ""
week of jan . 21 :
if all goes well , "" netcoonline "" will be launched on tuesday , january 22 , with at least financial products ( timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues ) .

vince & stinson ,
i was given your names by lynn dunphy in recruiting and am taking the liberty
of forwarding you the attached cv . steve roeder is a former collegiate
swimmer and currently coach of the master ' s swimming program in the woodlands
( my wife is president of the program ) . he is also currently employed at air
liquide usa ( or one of its subsidiaries ) over in the galleria area . as a
consequence of air liquide ' s pending merger with boc , steve believes that
there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is
taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge .
lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and i would be grateful
if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested .
alternatively , if you don ' t see a fit ( or are adequately staffed at the
moment ) , i would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom i
might contact internally on steve ' s behalf .
many thanks in advance .

mike -
thanks for taking the time to talk last evening . ? i really appreciated it . ?
( by the way , how is life in the white house now that you are living with a
president ? ? is air force one all that it is cracked up to be ? )
please see the attached document . ? by reading between the lines , hopefully
one can see that , whereas my training has been highly technical , my desire to
transform my career into the business side of a high - technology application
is set in this good foundation ( rather than limited by it ) .
thanks again for your support .

"Subject: california update 6 / 1 / 01
below are details of new plan currently being created by california state treasurer phil angelides and supported by sen . burton . the plan is in the initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast - track . it is also not motivated by a desire to save socal from bankruptcy . the creator ' s goal is to give californians more control over their energy and electric futures as well as giving the tax / rate payers a share of the pie in return for money that has / will go to the utilities . we will continue to monitor this plan , its supporters and progress .
plan z
california state treasurer phil angelides and a powerful group of legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve california ' s energy crisis this summer . the group is comprised of leftish legislators , environmental advocates , in - state energy company executives and business leaders and they are pulling together a plan z . at the core of the plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a california public power authority that issues bonds , constructs new power plants and buys up transmission lines . there is even talk within this group of using newly legislated authority to buy socal edison for $ 3 . 5 billion ( less than it owes ) although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power companies as well as edison itself .
the five - year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee a 5 % - 15 % "" cushion "" against energy peak demand . angelides and burton want to create enough capacity to form a buyer ' s market . one of the points of the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector generation . this plan may short - circuit private sector plans to build new plants , but the state has the ability to issue $ 5 b in revenue - backed bonds ( in addition to the $ 12 b rate - backed bonds ) . the second key element in the angelides - burton plan z is additional rate hikes for california ' s consumers and businesses . although discussions are still underway between this group and business leaders , angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45 % increase in residential and commercial electricity rates , however , there is immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on businesses . this increase is on top of the 50 % - 60 % already mandated by previous puc decisions this year . these rate increases will do two things : stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of california and prevent emergency tax hikes ( being serious considered last week ) .
issues to consider in regards to this plan are : ( 1 ) how much will current shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long - owed debts ( or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of socal edison ) ; and ( 2 ) how much will creditors have to "" eat "" in the legislated repayment plan ? in other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts be ? there is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year .",0

that is good news . in mexico and probably elsewhere in latin america , we can use this unit for information gathering purposes in return for a quantifiable risk since o & m agreements are typically capped in terms of overall exposure . it may be tough to break into third - party projects ( assuming we would want to strategically ) , but at least on projects that we initiate , we can keep a handhold even after we sell down our equity stake .

i enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible enron / argonne national laboratory collaboration . as i mentioned , one of our divisions , decision information sciences has built state of the art tools for modeling and simulating energy use . they have trained many country energy ministries on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy technology issues .
i ' ve attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in this area . decision information sciences also has done much work in studying critical infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also may be of interest . finally , they have been pioneers in the development of agent based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that are impossible to view with over approaches .
i will also include a copy of my correspondences with one of your e - business groups under separate transmission .

subject : possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana
i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows :
most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers .
as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants .
one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from .
there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 .
if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule .
the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent .
this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space .
robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added .
in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center .

car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .

texans bake as electricity usage hits record
by today , a "" cool "" spell was expected to grip texas , plunging temperatures
down to around 100 . a nice respite from the 105 - plus temperatures that

for the third time this year .
the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) , an industry coalition that
administers the state ' s power grid and serves 85 % of the state ' s electric
load , reported friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity
usage reached an all - time peak high for the third time in 44 days last
thursday , with texans using 57 , 731 mw of power . of course , that was before
the weekend , when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some
locations in the state - - - just in time for labor day picnics .
the new usage record last thursday broke the previous record set the day
before , on wednesday , when consumers used 55 , 994 mw of power . the two broken
records broke a record set just six weeks earlier , july 19 , when texans used

i love your product ! ! !
i have smoked for 40 + years , and i quit cold turkey .
basically , i took final smoke , and a couple of hours later tried
to smoke a cigarette . but i was absolutely sick from it !
i now can keep up enjoy my grandchildren without coughing wheezing ! !

http : / / goodsvcs . com / qsl / index . html - - - to quit forever ! ( if you don ' t quit - you don ' t pay ! )
i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

marcello finished 5 th ( out of 30 ) in the caterham 7 ' s at brands hatch on sunday so he ' s famous too now !
carly fiorina tops fortune ' s list of 50 most powerful women in business for fourth year
10 / 01 / 2001
business wire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire )
new york - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 1 , 2001 - -
lower - profile women topple more well - known names from tech and
internet sector ; ranking includes 14 newcomers
though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business .
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 .
in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april .
in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . ""
fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says .
as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter .
fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon .
while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first .
in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins .
in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou - sze , vice president , hewlett - packard ( hong kong ) ; patricia barbizet , ceo , artemis ( france ) ; eiko kono , president , recruit ( japan ) : belinda stronach , ceo , magna international ( canada ) ; marina berlusconi , vice chairman , fininvest ( italy ) ; christine tsung , president & ceo , china airlines ( taiwan ) . you can read about the other forty at www . fortune . com or in the international editions of fortune .

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity
another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .
the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .
one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .
although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .
an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry
in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .
the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .
just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .
below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .
the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .
stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .
rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !
rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .
but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc
for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .
rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .
rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards
earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .
the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .
this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .
$ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries
mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico
with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .
the problems with traditional money transfer methods
with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .
with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .
what is the best way to send remittances ?
by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .
the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .
rlyc has already begun filling orders
in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .
rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers
rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .
rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings
some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !
rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions
through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .
rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .
rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market
rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .
health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .
this could be an enormous new market for rlyc
it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .
experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .
e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .
prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .
relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team
the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .
with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .
this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

tradestar corporation ( otc : tirr )
symbol tirr
est . shares outstanding 38 , 000 , 000
est . float 2 , 000 , 000
recent price $ 0 . 71
tirr is up over 70 % in the past two weeks ! ! !
tradestar corporation ( tirr ) finishes recompletion of karnes county tx oil well bringing on 35 bpd in production ! ! !
readers who have followed oil stock recommendations ( otcbb : svse and asurf ) in the past have profited nicely .
the company
tradestar corp . ( otc : tirr ) , is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re - entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america . new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over 90 % . tradestar corp . is engaged in the low - risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth . the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling , completion and production techniques , have resulted in :
1 accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area .
2 co - mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well - - increasing both initial and total output .
3 the opportunity to drill new offset wells - - where success rates are typically over 90 % . ( using oil @ $ 35 . 00 and gas @ $ 4 . 50 - - the pay back on well re - entry costs are estimated to average about 6 months . oil is currently $ 48 and gas $ 6 ! ! ! !
tirr ' s strategy is to strike oil again ! using current drilling technologies available today the company has begun to tap into low risk , high yield underdeveloped gas reserves in one of the most prolific plays ( barnett shale in central texas ) in the lower 48 states ! ! ! with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties , an aggressive acquisition campaign , experienced management team , and application of cutting edge ep technologies , we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio .
investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of skyrocketing world energy prices . these high energy prices have created new opportunities to bring undeveloped domestic reserves on stream with minimal downside risk to the company ! ! ! !
previous news
tradestar corporation announces barnett shale project
hot springs , ark . , - - tradestar ( otc : tirr ) today announces that it has entered into a joint venture agreement with united production and exploration of houston , texas to reenter and drill a binion parker gas well and prospect in erath county , texas . in addition to the gas well reentry , the prospect , which covers 111 acres , has an additional location to drill a new well . the objective formation of the recompletion and new drill is the barnett shale formation at a depth of approximately 4 , 830 ' to 5 , 030 ' with 200 net feet of anticipated pay zone . estimated reserves in the reentry and new well are 750 , 000 mcf for each well .
why we love this stock
1 . continued rise in world oil gas prices !
2 . over 30 potential oil gas producing sites in the prolific barnett shale of central texas
3 . strong industry investment banking relationships
4 . strong management - over 50 years of experience in the oil patch
5 . multiple leaseholds and joint venture partners
6 . tight float , low entry price strong upward potential !
7 . business model offers only real solution to u . s . dependency on foreign oil .
8 . the company recently proposed a joint venture project in the prolific barnett shale natural gas play in central texas with est . reserves of over 10 trillion cubic ft of gas !
conclusion
tradestar corp . ( tirr ) is getting ready to become a major presence in oil gas fields across texas . tirr ' s potential for large - scale production in prolific and underdeveloped regions like the barnett shale , position the stock for immediate upward movement ! ! ! we believe that tirr is in position to take the petroleum industry by storm . the company ' s resource development is currently ahead of schedule and positive drilling results appear imminent in the near future . revenues are up 50 % over the lst quarter of last year . don ' t miss this fantastic opportunity . for more information on tirr , go to tradestar - corp . com for sec filings or press releases .
this is one of our top recommendations this year . we are giving tirr our seal of approval .

"Subject: presentation for cal berkeley
hello vince and john ,
i wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus . we can
tweak these however we feel appropriate to match cal berkeley on monday . i
believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students ( based on interest
shown at the career fair ) . these tend to be fairly informal . i was thinking
that we could present in this order :
vince gives the enron overview presentation ( 30 minutes )
john gives the global technology specific presentation ( 20 minutes )
ashley goes over recruiting information at the end ( 10 minutes )
please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you
feel comfortable with the layout and content . i am meeting with john today
at 1 : 30 - vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that
would be great .
if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to contact me . 3 - 3589
thanks ,
ashley
vince , here is a copy of the current enron overview presentation . there are
also speaker notes that go into great detail .
john , here is a copy of the current technology presentation for carnegie
mellon . the only changes will be to the recruiting dates at the end . there
are also speaker notes that go into greater detail . - - - >",0

i have given your email to richard bryant , who is the director of the comp .
fin . program at cmu . no doubt he will be in touch . here ' s a link :
i feel that i should mention something : from my experience at cmu , there are
three types of students . those that work very very hard and are basically
ethical ; those that cheat their way through school , and the sharks . it is
very difficult to distinguish between the groups when interviewing . in my
class of about 30 students , there were three sharks , about six or seven hard
workers , and then there was everyone else . anyway , for what its worth !

"Subject: confidential - - re : august 24 tw conference call minutes
following up on my "" to do "" from our conference call , the information below
may be useful as we attempt to justify capital / operational expenditures on
the tw system :
objective : try and quantify in revenue terms the lost value of decreased
west throughput to tw
first a few assumptions :
fuel prices used were : permian = $ 4 . 785 / mmbtu and san juan = $ 4 . 14 / mmbtu
baseload volume flowing west was assumed to be 1 , 090 , 000 mmbtu / d
fuel consumed = 2 %
revenue impact is based upon current contracts and assumes lost fuel and
commodity charges only . tw continues to collect the reservation charges .
result :
based on current gas fuel prices , for every 1000 mmbtu / d delivery we lose on
the west end , this translates to approximately $ 150 / day of lost revenue . if
we assume the pressure drop at station 1 is preventing us from delivering
25 , 000 mmbtu / d into socal , then the lost revenue for tw would be $ 3 , 305 per
day or $ 1 , 206 , 000 per year . to give you an idea of the significance of the
fuel value , of the $ 3 , 305 daily revenue , approximately $ 3 , 072 of it is fuel
related .
one more thing :
we assume here that tw continues to collect the reservation charges .
however , on a long term basis , if the west condition continues , we run the
risk of losing the reservation as well . based on 25 , 000 mmbtu / d , this value
equals $ 2 , 500 , 000 per year .
let me know if you have questions . i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 5559

just want to give you a couple of updates .
the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser
and chris gaskill yesterday . the overall response was very positive . based
on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end
of the week .
the cost for the d & b data has been reduced by $ 100 k after additional
negotiations . pursuant to that , the agreement was signed last week . the
requested data was received yesterday .

subject : global entelligence status
just wanted to let you know a few updates :
1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the
first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with
sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on
functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks .
2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from
the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining
phases .
3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of
customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense
amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with
other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall
budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k .
i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request
of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from
d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate
better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this
could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready
to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try
something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money .
therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next
three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b
is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their
development resources off of this project until they receive a signed
agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our
delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep
them moving or sign the proposal at that time .
give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items .",0

the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax ( "" sales / use tax "" ) liability related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of various equipment ( i . e . , turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee and indiana ) used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois , indiana and tennessee . enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pursuant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny ( effectively , this tax liability is a "" pre - acquisition date "" tax liability that we , as the seller , are responsible for ) . typically , the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed sales / use tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny . the ews tax department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sales / use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time ( for example , a sales - leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sales / use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ) . ultimately , we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have ( and we believe did in the specific case of allegheny ) modelled the cost of the peakers as including the full current payment of such sales / use tax . that said , we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and , if challenged , there is a risk that we would not prevail . matt is out until may 8 ( he is a recent father of a baby girl ) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like . matt has worked closely with don and others in the generation asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound ( not overly conservative nor liberal ) position . best regards . steve .

executive summary
? legislative maneuvering towards a bail - out plan
mou developments
the assembly energy costs and availability committee held hearings yesterday on the socal bailout plan , ab 82 . the chairman of the committee , rod wright , has agreed with hertzberg and davis to move something out of the committee , possibly by mid - week . much of the assembly ' s efforts to move along a comprehensive plan have been encumbered by the introduction of over 50 amendments . additionally , demonstrations by a group of farmers and resort owners opposing the conservation easement provision included in the bill may also slow the process .
three central valley democrats ( reyes , flores and canciamilla ) on the assembly committee on energy costs and availability will likely be paying close attention to the demonstrations against the conservation easements , as farmers are significant in their districts . all three legislators face reelection . reyes has already signaled that , even though she voted for the bailout last time , she is disinclining to do so again . these three democrats may impede the progress of the bailout . there are strong indications that the plan will not come to a vote until it has the necessary votes to pass . at this point there still appears to be a lack of consensus on the democratic side .
another substantive amendment to the current plan has been a call by socal for "" fair market value "" of its transmission assets , rather than book value . this value , of course , would have to be estimated and essentially means that even more money would have to go toward the bailout . while committee chairman wright would not oppose this idea , it will likely be hard for many of his colleagues to swallow , particularly on the senate side .
once the amendments are disposed of and the bailout plan clears the assembly energy costs and availability committee , it will then go to assembly appropriations . the chair of this committee , carol migden , is friendly with both hertzberg and governor davis , so the plan appears unlikely to receive significant opposition in her committee . it will then go to the assembly floor for a vote . since it is likely some sort of bailout plan will pass the assembly , it likely will fall to the senate to decide ultimately if a socal bailout makes it to the governor or not . therefore , it becomes important to examine what deals might be made between burton and davis in order to get a bailout through the senate . for example , burton wants a change in the workers ' compensation laws to increase payouts to workers . this is a very important issue . on the one hand , both trial lawyers and the unions support burton . on the other hand , he is strongly opposed by the powerful ctma , the republicans and pro - business democrats , including governor davis . in fact , davis has already vetoed this legislation at least once and has promised to do so again . it is conceivable , though unlikely , that a deal could be struck whereby burton would allow a socal bailout to pass in exchange for davis signing workers ' compensation reform . however , if this were to happen , both the bailout and the workers ' comp reform together would be an enormous burden on california businesses at a time when these businesses are not doing well . this is why a deal on this particular topic appears unlikely at this time .",0

barry ,
thanks for the timely email . i have your name on my list of people to
contact this week as kevin hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our
group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk
system for ebs .
you are right that i haven ' t been spending much time on 44 . martin lin has
been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects
that we are supporting . we have been somewhat short handed since samer
takriti left the group last fall and we were out - bid by mckinsey for cantekin
dincerler who had helped us with ebs projects as an intern over the
summer . however , we do have additional help coming . iris mack , a very
bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management
experience , will be starting with the group next week . i am hoping that ,
together with martin , she will allow us to significantly increase the
research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently
undersupported .
can i get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas
where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to
introduce iris and martin to you ? almost any time would be fine , or you can
have your assistant coordinate with shirley crenshaw x 35290 .

gentlemen :
enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research
endeavor called the new economy value research lab . the lab is the result of
a joint effort between mit ' s sloan school of management and arthur andersen
( aa ) . its purpose is to develop "" quantitative valuations of the intangible
assets wall street finds increasingly important in the new economy "" ( business
week , 2 / 7 / 00 ) . clearly , as enron continues to shift from a hard asset to
intangible asset based organization , the question of "" how to "" accurately and
appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly
important .
last week , steve kean , vince kaminski , marie hejka , and myself met with a
team from aa , the deputy dean of the sloan school , and mit ' s lead
accounting / finance professor to discuss the intent of the lab , expected
outcomes , and how enron may be involved . post that meeting , the decision was
made to continue to explore participation in the lab . enron now needs to 1 )
define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs , and 2 ) identify
value attributes important to enron and the industries in which we operate .
once defined , a follow up meeting will be held with mit and next steps will
be determined .
your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and
outcomes of these next steps . please schedule time on tuesday august 1 from
2 : 00 to 3 : 30 to attend the next meeting , during which we will begin to
identify needs and define value attributes . location will be eb 49 c 4 . please
notify me if you are unable to attend .
lastly , to assist with preparation for this meeting , i am attaching notes
from a recently published book entitled cracking the value code : how
businesses are creating wealth in the new economy ( may 2000 , boulton , libert ,
samek - arthur andersen ) .
should you like more information on the lab , previous meeting , book or other ,

subject : ferc conference on el paso capacity allocation ( rpo 0 - 336 )
summary
though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to el paso ' s capacity allocation method ( including those in the pipeline ' s order 637 proceeding ) , and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline ' s allocation , major substantive issues were not covered at this conference . for instance , the battle between full requirements ( fr ) shippers and contract demand ( cd ) shippers came up marginally , but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of fr shippers to cd contracts .
procedurally , there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing , merits decision from the commission or settlement , though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision . staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions .
allocation studies ( models )
el paso opened the conference with a presentation / interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal ( march 27 ) would allocate the system ' s receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios . for nominations , receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers , and the model used 20 pools . the scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred ( based on those shipper - supplied preferences ) , solved the largest constraints first , then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation .
there were questions on the studies , what they show , what the assumptions are , etc . , and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies . shippers have requested six more allocation studies , showing possible impacts of seasonalization ( winter and summer ) and the difference between cd and full requirements coincidental and non coincidental peaks ( winter and summer , 1995 - 2000 ) .
el paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable , and in fact results in 247 mmcf / d of unallocated capacity ( 230 mmcf coming from the line 2000 expansion proposal , and an extra 17 mmcf ) . shippers were skeptical of the "" slack capacity "" finding .
other issues
? pooling : there was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools . it was noted that this should be addressed with order 637 issues , expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved .
? fr vs . cd : though there were some fr vs . cd shippers discussions , they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the tx , nm and az shippers ( fr ) and aera energy ( cd shippers ) . there was also no mention of converting fr shippers to cd service . note : never mentioned were the cd and fr complainants ' proposals that el paso ( 1 ) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or ( 2 ) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service ( rpol - 484 and 486 ) .
? release shippers : shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated , as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline ( which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated ) .
? receipt point designation : the question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools . when asked what commission policy is on pools vs . receipt points , both shippers and staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available . however , staff noted that in the flexibility vs . reliability debate , it could be argued that el paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability .
procedure going forward
the primary issue here ended up being procedural .
the procedural schedule is as follows :
? el paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing : sept . 24
? initial comments ( on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations ) : oct . 15
? reply comments : oct . 26",0

"Subject: re : coastal ctr # 96008903 meter 0984179 sit # 135714
having discussed the matter with brian riley , hpl has no intention of
contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price . it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal , relaying this
information and suggesting coastal ' s trader contract brian riley .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

"Subject: reimbursement of individually billed items
the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few
years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase
in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle .
although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual
employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these
cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we
try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of
employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this
increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less
productive than paying invoices .
to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary
for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and
other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay
for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions
are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through
employee expense reports .
by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of
checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the
turnaround time for payment of invoices .",0

"Subject: understanding risk and return of an insurance portfolio
hi vince ,
i am enclosing a report on my thoughts about risk and return behaviour of an
insurance portfolio . your input on this will be very helpful .
i have given vasant a copy of this report and am working with him towards
improving this . in the mean time , i happened to mention this idea in a
meeting with david porter , per sekse , brad blesie and david hoog and there
seems to be some interest in understanding how this works . in fact , david
hoog subsequently reviewed this with me and suggested some changes . those
changes have been included in this report .
the idea here is simple and just a starting point . while it provides a broad
picture on how risk and return will behave at portfolio level , i am hoping
to be able to relax some of the assumptions to get more realistic picture in
near future .
looking forward to your input ,
sincerely ,

* the power curve has softened since our last analysis ( power curve 4 ,

2003 , respectively . the spark spread , an important measure of profit
potential , has declined further : down 18 % , 32 % and 84 % , respectively .

keyed off of strong 2 q expectations . recommend shifting portfolio toward

"Subject: request for training session
folks ,
i am a vice president with enron , and have been with the company some 6 years
now . i was hired through enron associate pool , and started off by marketing
power on the east coast with jim fallon . currently i am working in the india
region , looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities in
india , anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future .
one of my challenges is to make the team in india aware of the type of
sophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for trading
activities , as well as the range of products we have to offer .
i have been in conversation with mike mcconnell and jeff shankman on the
global products side , and are planning a session to acquaint the team in
india with activities in that group . similarly , on the power side , we have
been interacting with john sherriff ' s team in london .
i feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to get
acquainted with the processes on the power trading side in houston , and to
get an idea of the rac process , the research side , the back - offices , as well
as the trading operations here . similarly , the team there could present to
you the state of the market in india , and give you an idea of the type of
opportunities there . i am therefore eliciting your support to put together a
session in houston where they can be acquainted with these functions , as well
as the people responsible for them in the us . there are three people in the
group who would benefit from this exposure . one of them is from the
associate pool , while the other two are people hired locally in india .
i have already spoken with our coo , wade cline in this regard , and seek your
support in putting together an agenda for such a session . please let me know
who i should contact within your groups to discuss this further .
regards ,
sandeep .",0

enron ceo casts vote to save dpc , tina edwin & soma banerjee
amul ' s creative directors may have gone back to ad - libbing ' enron or
enr - off ' , but for the big kahuna at the american utility , dabhol is still a
worthwhile project . while the entire enron board had almost decided to call
it quits and proceed with the termination of the $ 2 . 9 - billion power project
at dabhol , the veto exercised by the company chairman kenneth lay has saved
the project  * - at least for the timebeing . sources said the meeting held on
tuesday at the energy major ' s headquarters in houston could have sounded the
death knell for the only big foreign investment in the indian power sector .
although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lenders
unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not
honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled , the veto exercised at
this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost
to the indian venture . company sources said : "" we do not know what went on
there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out . "" with the
engineering procurement and construction contractors ge and equipment
suppliers bechtel too in a cautious mode mode , dpc was finding it even more
difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules .
sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board would
be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its
shareholders if the project actually flopped . enron had similar bitter
experiences in pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then
justify such investments to the shareholders .
enron , which had planned a major investments in india ' s infrastructure
sectors such as oil and gas , lng , gas transportation , telecom and broadband
network , has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these
operations . the company ' s mous with various other majors like indian oil
corporation , too , is in a limbo and the us major ' s stake in the oil and gas
venture is up for grabs . however , even though lay is still hoping to find a
solution to the controversy back home , both dpc and mseb are still to get
down to negotiations .

maharashtra ' unhappy ' with delay in naming godbole nominee
the maharashtra government has expressed ' unhappiness ' over the centre ' s
delay in appointing its nominee on the nine - member godbole committee to
renegotiate the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between enron promoted
dabhol power company ( dpc ) and the maharashtra state electricity board
( mseb ) . "" the committee , which is to hold discussions with enron officials
from houston on may 11 , has only a month ' s time for renegotiations and with
dpc ' s termination notice threat hanging on our head , time is actually running
out . yet there is no official to represent the union government , "" a senior
state government official said here on sunday . "" there are media reports that
solicitor general harish salve would be appointed , but we are yet to hear
anything from their side , "" he said .
the official said that the state expected the centre to announce their
representative before may 11 , as it would appreciate his crucial presence in
the first session of discussions with enron officials , lenders and gas
suppliers . sources in the mantralaya added that the government had also been
unhappy over the centre ' s rigid stand on not allowing state - owned national
thermal power corporation ( ntpc ) to buy the excess capacity of dpc ' s total
2 , 184 mw project . "" let ntpc and power trading corporation of india ( ptc ) come
together and sell dpc ' s surlpus power . we have already mooted this
suggestion , but a favourable reply is yet to come from the union power
ministry , "" the official said . the official said that the centre , which was
also responsible for dpc project as it has provided counter guarantee to
enron india , should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess
power to other states . the state government ' s reaction comes in wake of union
power minister suresh prabhu ' s discussion with chief minister vilasrao
deshmukh in delhi few days ago . it was learnt that prabhu told deshmukh
"" there is no question of ntpc buying power from the project since long term
ppas have been signed by ntpc with the buying states "" .
deshmukh had suggested that the central power utility should sell excess
power over and above the 300 - 400 mw needed for the state from the dpc ' s 740
mw phase - i and soon to be commissioned phase - ii of 1 , 444 mw , to other needy
states . considering the high cost of power generated from dpc , which during
the recent months has hovered around rs 7 per unit as against an average cost
of rs 2 . 30 - 2 . 80 a unit from central and state utilities , there would be few
takers for the power from dabhol , the power minister reportedly said .
"" deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought
down , "" he said , adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power
to the buyers .

reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties
arijit de , s ravindran & renni abraham in mumbai
in an unusual departure from normal practice , the maharashtra government has
allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its 447 - mw patalganga
power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state
electricity board ( mseb ) does not lift power . the project  , s power purchase
agreement ( ppa ) has a clause to this effect . the state government  , s
permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the
context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power
company  , s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third
parties .
dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company  , s
application had been pending with the chief minister  , s office for months .
only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to
negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state . the dpc project
is facing the threat of closure following mseb  , s inability to buy power from
it , thanks to the board  , s weak financial position . not only can the
reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra , but it can
sell power to utilities outside the state . the ppa does not expressly bar it
from doing so . nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power
can be sold . so , in effect , this suggests that the group could sell power to
industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to
the mseb . the state electricity board derives over 80 per cent of its revenue
from such consumers .
apart from captive power plants , independent power producers in india are
allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards . they can sell power
outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status . with
its 447 - mw capacity , the patalganga project is not eligible for such status
because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of 1 , 000
mw . speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week , reliance
industries managing director anil ambani told business standard : a provision
in third parties . ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb  , s weak
financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised
in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would
derail the patalganga project .
the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside
the state , a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response
to questions . a senior mseb official explained that the state government
cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the
unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former
mseb official . subsequently , it was realised that the state would be stuck
with excess power . so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third
parties , he said . the patalganga project along with the ispat group  , s 1 , 082
mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits
its second
report .

no need of patalganga , bhadravati power : mseb
the axe seems to have finally fallen on the much - delayed reliance
industries - promoted patalganga and ispat industries ' bhadravati power
projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the
government that "" there is no need of these projects nor their power "" . the
loss - making board has communicated to the government that mseb had "" no
interest "" in patalganga and bhadravati , as it did not have escrow - able
capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down
tremendously in maharashtra , state government sources said here on sunday .
"" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state
government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two
projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and
unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of
dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .
after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based
power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has
already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw
patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major
has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman
vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per
the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give
further details .
currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per
godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and
energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an
escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance
representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .
sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve
financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to
fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from
mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc . "" all the three were cleared
as ' fast - track ' projects , but other than enron , reliance and ispat have been
caught in a quagmire , especially bhadravati , which has been hanging afire
since last nine years , "" they added .
moreover , the mseb official opined that given the current situation , if dpc
calls it quits from india , bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance ' s
patalganga . patalganga ' s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc ' s
that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4 . 50 per unit to as high as rs
7 , while bhadravati ' s cost could be around rs 3 . 80 to rs 4 per unit , he
informed . mseb ' s installed capacity ended on march 31 , 2001 , wasl 4 , 000 mw and
it has generated 45 , 000 million units with transmission and distribution
losses as high as 39 per cent . ( pti )

global bankers ask govt to honour dpc obligations
tamal bandyopadhyay , surajeet dasgupta & santosh tiwary in mumbai / newdelhi
global arrangers for the dabhol power company have mounted fresh pressure on
the finance ministry to honour the union government  , s counter - guarantee and
have also set strict conditions for reconsidering the termination of the
power purchase agreement ( ppa ) between the dpc and the maharashtra state
electricity board ( mseb ) . in a related development , the dpc has sent a note
to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the turn
of events as they have prevented the dpc from serving the ppa termination
notice last month .
the lenders . in their turn , sent a statement - - prepared by the new
york - based legal firm white & case - - defending their stance saying they are
working in the best interest of the project . the lenders are expected to
meet in london over the next fortnight to take stock of the situation . the
deadline for resolving the issues are drawing to a close as 10 days of the
three - week reprieve have passed . at the dpc board meeting in london on may
25 , the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination
notice and got three weeks  , time for themselves to convince the centre as
well as the maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the
controversial project . in a letter to finance secretary ajit kumar dated
april 30 , the global arrangers said the government must own up its
responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay . among the
stiff conditions , set by the arrangers , are the demand that the central
government ensure payment of all the pending bills of mseb for december
2000 , january 2001 , february 2001 and march 2001 which remain unpaid
without any protest or reservation by may 7 ( monday ) .
any payment previously made under  & protest  8 should be made free and clear of
such protest or any other reservation , and the center should ensure timely
payment of future bills by mseb , they said . meanwhile , sources said that the
finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the
dabhol projects in london stand on the issue . the lenders  , list of demands
also include asking mseb to take steps required under the existing
contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of
financial close of phase ii of the project by may 7 .
they have demanded that the union government and the maharashtra government
should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will
take any step to impede the operation of phase i or the construction and
operation of phase ii without due cause . the lenders have also asked them to
ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and
equipment required for the project by may 21 . csfb , anz export finance ,
citi , bank of america and abn amro are the global arrangers for both phase i
as well as phase ii of the project .
the state bank of india , which is also a global arranger for phase ii , did
not sign the letter . "" ten days have passed since the lenders bought three
weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of
the ppa . since then , nothing has moved at the material level barring mseb ' s
payment of the january bill to the tune of rs 134 crore under protest , "" said
a source among the global arrangers . come forward to meet its obligations
the lenders are planning to meet around mid - may in london and this time
they will be left with no choice but to give the go - ahead to the company to
terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the
issue , the source added . the lenders are , however , not ready to take the
blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company . the
white & case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of the
project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the
last option - - termination of ppa .

ge may pull out as dpc supplier , s ravindran in mumbai
after us - based bechtel , it is now the turn of general electric to review its
participation as equipment supplier to the controversial 2 , 184 - mw power
project in maharashtra , being set up by the dabhol power company . bechtel is
the epc contractor to the project while ge has supplied the equipment ,
primarily turbines . general electric , like bechtel , also holds 10 per cent in
dabhol power company ( dpc ) . and both bechtel and general electric are worried
about future payments from dpc . sources familiar with the project said that
so far dpc has not defaulted in its payments to general electric . what is
worrying general electric is the possible scenario after june 7 , when about
700 mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs .
dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have been locked in a
payments dispute for months . if mseb continues with its stance , dpc in turn
may not be able to pay general electric . in such a situation , ge may walk out
of the project . a final decision will be taken only in june , said sources .
general electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by business
standard . senior executives at its public relations agency burson
marsteller roger pereira said that only dpc executives were authorised to
speak on the issue . the dpc spokesman declined to comment on the issue .
the first phase of the 740 mw has already been commissioned . after the second
phase of 1 , 444 mwis commissioned by december , 2001 , mseb will have to pay
dpc a minimum of rs 500 crore per month . the escrow account for this was to
have been made operational by april 7 , 2001 . mseb has refused to do this .
earlier , dpc had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract
with the board . mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has
absolved dpc of all its liabilities .
consequently , it will not operationalise the escrow account . this casts a
further shadow over dpc  , s ability to pay general electric and bechtel . this
is worrying the lenders to the project as well . the situation has taken a
turn for the worse with dpc practically refusing to re - negotiate the contract
for the second phase with the godbole panel constituted by the maharashtra
government .

godbole panel meets sans dabhol representation
the godbole committee , set up for renegotiating the estranged power purchase
agreement between us energy major enron - promoted dabhol power company and the

representatives of the multinational . "" it was an internal meeting to take
stock of the current situation and decide on matter pertaining to the may 11
meet with officials of enron , ge , bechtel and dpc ' s foreign lenders , "" said
state government sources . the meeting , which lasted for almost four hours ,

were hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri director r k pachauri , former union

centre and central electricity authority . the negotiating committee would
suggest solutions to bring down the exorbitant power tariff , separating of

ntpc not to buy power from enron : govt
the centre has ruled out the possibility of national thermal power
corporation buying power generated by us energy giant enron - promoted dabhol
power company . union power minister suresh prabhu is learnt to have stated
this during the meeting with maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh
last month , convened by the finance minister yashwant sinha to discuss the
enron crisis , said government sources on friday .
prabhu had pointed out that "" there is no question of ntpc buying power from
the project since long - term power purchase agreements have been signed by
ntpc with the buying states "" . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh
during the meeting suggested that the central power utility sell the excess
power over and above the 300 - 400 mw needed for the state from the 740 mw
phase - i and soon - to - be - commissioned phase - ii of 1 , 444 - mw , to other needy
states . when contacted , prabhu said the entire controversy over payment
default by maharashtra state electricity board owing to high cost of power
generated by dpc had to be resolved between the state government , and dpc and
centre had very limited role to play . dpc has already slapped one
conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state
government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 - crore - plus interest
rate towards bills due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 . ( pti )

new york - - volatility and premiums on enron ' s near - month options remain extremely high . it is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors .
enron near - month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session wednesday , as investors bought them to hedge . the december 5 puts traded more than 10 , 000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $ 1 . 10 at the chicago board options exchange . the stock closed down $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 , as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading .
enron ' s calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income . traders noted some call buying - - especially after enron procured a three - week extension on a $ 690 million note - - as some hopeful investors bet on enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with dynegy inc . enron ' s december 5 calls traded more than 14 , 500 contracts , compared with open interest of 710 , as they fell $ 1 . 45 to $ 1 . 15 at the cboe .
for investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten - down stocks , the "" wash sale "" rule can be a hurdle , because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "" substantially identical "" securities within a 30 - day period before or after that loss . this poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive "" buy "" candidates .
in addition , the internal revenue service has taken the position that the wash - sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in - the - money put , because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor .
so investors typically get around the wash - sale rule by "" doubling up "" : buying additional stock or options , waiting at least 31 days , and then selling the original stock to book the loss . investors double up by buying calls , which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock .

dynegy deal to buy enron hits crossroads

even as it reiterated its intention to purchase enron corp . , dynegy inc . is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion - dollar deal .
the pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the houston energy - trading company , the nation ' s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas . during the past month , enron has taken a $ 1 billion write - off of assets , revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .
the problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partnerships , run by some of its own executives , under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . in an sec filing monday , enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write - offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $ 2 billion in loans by the end of the year .
as of 4 p . m . wednesday in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares fell $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 each after having dropped 23 % tuesday . in excess of 115 million shares traded wednesday , more than four times the volume of any other big board stock . enron ' s bonds also again traded sharply lower , market observers said .
the turmoil spilled over to dynegy ' s stock , which also was among the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . as of 4 p . m . wednesday , dynegy shares fell $ 1 . 94 to $ 39 . 76 each .
on wednesday , dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said his company was working "" to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement "" though it continued to perform "" due diligence "" on enron .
under the merger agreement , dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if enron ' s financial and legal problems become severe enough . however , some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so - called material adverse change clauses . they point to a decision earlier this year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc . to complete a planned purchase of ibp inc . even though tyson , a springdale , ark . , food - products company , had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in ibp ' s earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit .
dynegy officials didn ' t return calls seeking comment . to complete the deal , two - thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders would have to give their approval . no dates for those votes have been set .
one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enron contained information dynegy hadn ' t known about . dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company ' s due diligence , this person said . it couldn ' t be determined what the new information was .
the merger agreement , announced nov . 9 , calls for dynegy to exchange 0 . 2685 share for each of enron ' s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares , giving the purchase a value of about $ 9 billion at dynegy ' s current stock price . however , from a price standpoint , the deal is appearing less attractive to dynegy .
on the day of the merger announcement , enron shares were trading at about $ 8 . 63 each , or about 83 % of the purchase price under the exchange ratio . as of wednesday , enron ' s market price was only about 47 % of the merger - formula price . such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement , when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price .
sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger . initially , many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron and provide a major boost to houston - based dynegy . dynegy and enron officials have predicted that the merger , supposed to be completed late next year , would significantly and immediately increase dynegy ' s earnings .
now analysts are challenging that assumption . ron barone , managing director at ubs warburg llc , said he believes that because of enron ' s financial problems , a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than dynegy would have by itself . mr . barone said he thinks a "" likely scenario "" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 . 15 dynegy share for each enron share .
such a ratcheting down wouldn ' t be without precedent in the deal . according to one person familiar with the merger negotiations , dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the nov . 9 announcement because of enron ' s rapidly sinking stock price , which at the beginning of this year was above $ 80 a share .
in perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on wall street , goldman sachs analyst david fleischer lowered his ratings on enron and dynegy . a longtime enron fan , mr . fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help dynegy ' s earnings and whether enron could "" recover the significant business that has been lost "" in its giant energy - trading operations . "" the enron machine continues to sputter , "" mr . fleischer wrote .
some observers say that if dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly , enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy - law filing . without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers , an enron bankruptcy - court filing "" is highly possible , "" said ralph pellecchia , a senior director at fitch , a credit - ratings agency . on wednesday , fitch maintained its credit rating on enron at just one notch above noninvestment - grade , or "" junk , "" status . but fitch also said it believed enron ' s trading partners had made "" significant cash collateral calls "" in recent days that are "" well in excess of previous expectations , "" contributing to "" liquidity pressures . ""
among the advisers enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of weil , gotshal & manges , which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate - workout situations . asked about a possible bankruptcy filing , an enron spokeswoman said the company expects the dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn ' t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger . since the merger announcement , enron chairman kenneth lay has said his company had alternatives to the dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them . enron said it made some progress improving its financial position . the company said it reached a final agreement with units of j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . on the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 billion in secured credit lines . enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $ 690 million note to mid - december from next week . the spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn ' t be required this year .

enron faces suits by 401 ( k ) plan participants

enron corp . , the embattled houston energy and trading company , has been sued by members of its employee - retirement plan , which has suffered losses because of enron ' s plummeting stock price .
two separate lawsuits , filed in federal court in houston , allege enron misled participants in its 401 ( k ) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company ' s shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell . amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks , the company "" locked down "" the retirement plan from oct . 17 to nov . 19 to make administrative changes , which prevented employees from selling enron shares as the share price collapsed .
enron , which recently agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , houston , because of mounting financial problems , has seen its stock price fall to $ 5 . 01 on wednesday from a peak of nearly $ 90 a share last year . the decline has been costly to participants in enron ' s retirement plan because more than 60 % of the 401 ( k ) assets were invested in enron shares at the end of last year , according to one of the suits .
the first suit was filed nov . 13 on behalf of plan participants by campbell harrison & wright llp , a houston law firm , and the second was filed tuesday by seattle - based hagens berman llp . both seek class - action certification .
enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits . a spokeswoman also said the company ' s 401 ( k ) plan offers participants 18 investment choices , one of which is company stock .
the company ' s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off - balance - sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials . the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the company ' s accounting , and enron has said it will restate years of financial information .
the suits against enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company - stock portion of their 401 ( k ) plans . the suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock , even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price . all the suits are pending .
as with most of these companies , enron matches employee contributions to the 401 ( k ) with shares of enron stock , and also offers enron stock as an investment choice , in addition to a variety of mutual funds . about $ 1 . 3 billion of the plan ' s $ 2 . 1 billion in assets was invested in enron shares at the end of 2000 , according to the suit filed by campbell harrison .
pamela tittle , a participant in the 401 ( k ) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the enron suit filed by campbell harrison & wright , had roughly 2 , 000 shares of enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $ 140 , 000 as a result of the stock ' s decline . the suit alleges that the trustees of the enron 401 ( k ) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril .
the suit filed by hagens berman , also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in enron stock . in addition , it accuses enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the sec .
roy e . rinard , a lineman for enron in oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by hagens berman , has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $ 70 , 000 from $ 470 , 000 , largely as a result of the decline in enron ' s stock . "" i feel like i have been betrayed , "" mr . rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers . "" i lost my savings , my plans for the future , everything . ""
under federal pension law , companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans , and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock . enron doesn ' t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401 ( k ) plan until age 50 .
however , plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants , which includes choosing prudent investments . generally , to prove that the plan ' s administrators breached their fiduciary duties , employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment . this presents a high hurdle , so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401 ( k ) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities .
lynn sarko , one of ms . tittle ' s attorneys with seattle ' s keller rohrback llp , is also co - lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against lucent technologies inc . , murray hill , n . j . another firm representing ms . tittle is dalton gotto samson & kilgard plc , which is lead counsel in a similar suit against ikon office solutions inc . , malvern , pa . the two law firms are representing ms . tittle with campbell harrison & wright .
the suits against lucent and ikon , like the suit against enron , allege that then - current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price . representatives for ikon and lucent say their companies didn ' t require employees to invest in the company stock , and educated employees about the need for diversification .
the suit in which mr . rinard is plaintiff notes that on oct . 17 , a day after enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $ 1 . 01 billion in the third quarter , enron "" locked down "" the 401 ( k ) plan ' s assets , preventing participants from selling enron shares . ( a "" lock - down "" occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another , and generally lasts several weeks , during which time participants can ' t make changes in their investment choices ) .
the lock - down was lifted on nov . 19 . in the interim , on nov . 8 , enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000 . by the time the lock - down was lifted , as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $ 9 a share from $ 32 . 20 on oct . 17 , when the lockup started , hagens berman attorney karl barth said .
"" they were locked into it right when enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news , "" mr . barth said . "" mr . rinard ' s looking at having no retirement savings now . it ' s a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50 s . ""

from sunbeam to enron , andersen ' s reputation suffers

this has been the worst year ever for arthur andersen , the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry . the securities and exchange commission filed civil fraud complaints against the andersen partner who audited sunbeam and against the firm itself in the waste management case .
now enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by arthur andersen , in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company ' s reported profits in recent years .
all of which raises the question : has arthur andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry ?
it is not an easy question to answer , and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment . ' ' if you want to attack andersen for enron , you need to know more than we know , ' ' arthur levitt , the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission , said this week .
but if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases , it is materiality . in all three cases , andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead .
materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble . the idea is that it doesn ' t much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong . but they can add up .
at enron , however , they did not add up to that much - - a total of $ 93 million over four years . the biggest restatement of enron profits concerns a related party that enron now says should have been consolidated . it is not clear if andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time .
to those who treasure the role of auditors , the humiliation of andersen is painful . back in the 1950 ' s , it was leonard spacek , andersen ' s managing partner , who warned that ' ' the profession ' s existence is in peril ' ' because it was not showing enough independence . his public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job . two decades ago , when the issue on the table was pension accounting , andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules .
now andersen ' s backbone is open to question . it was evidence that senior people at andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from waste management that led the s . e . c . to bring that suit , which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong . the partner that the s . e . c . says looked the other way at sunbeam is fighting the accusations , and andersen says he acted properly .
lynn turner , who was chief accountant of the s . e . c . at the time and is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university , says what is happening to andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to coopers & lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits .
' ' we got bludgeoned to death in the press , ' ' he said . ' ' people did not even want to see us at their doorsteps . it was brutal , but we deserved it . we had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls . ' ' by that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting .
for andersen to avoid that fate , its relatively new chief executive , joseph berardino , who declined to be interviewed for this column , will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that mr . spacek epitomized . and then he will have to convince the public of that .

chase and j . p . morgan ' s paper anniversary
a year after the merger , rosy plans meet reality
by riva d . atlas

when william b . harrison jr . speaks of last year ' s $ 31 billion merger of j . p . morgan and the chase manhattan corporation , he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34 - year career of helping build a giant of the banking business .
' ' this is the first merger i ' ve been part of , ' ' said mr . harrison , the chief executive of the combined bank , ' ' where i feel our core business is complete . ' '
the chase - j . p . morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite , just as mr . harrison intended . but with wall street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together , the many mergers , stock sales and other money - making opportunities that were supposed to justify the high - priced acquisition have largely dried up for now .
consequently , deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that mr . harrison , 58 , may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal , this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on wall street .
j . p . morgan chase has won some prominent assignments , like handling the revampings of troubled giants like lucent and , more recently , enron , the beleaguered energy trading company .
but while j . p . morgan chase is proud of serving alongside citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to enron on its acquisition by dynegy , the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank . with enron ' s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts , j . p . morgan chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with dynegy on track .
thanks largely to the slump on wall street , j . p . morgan chase ' s profits fell by two - thirds in the third quarter , to $ 449 million from $ 1 . 4 billion in the period a year ago . its stock has dropped 15 percent this year , more than other banks ' shares . the bank ' s stock is ahead of investment banks like goldman sachs , with which j . p . morgan chase increasingly competes .
' ' the jury is still out in many respects on this merger , ' ' said judah kraushaar , an analyst at merrill lynch . nevertheless , he likes j . p . morgan chase ' s stock , he said , because ' ' expectations are very low . ' '
all j . p . morgan chase ' s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on wall street . but some , like citigroup , are better diversified and have greater involvement in old - fashioned consumer banking , which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year .
nearly a third of j . p . morgan chase ' s revenues are consumer - oriented . by contrast , its chief new york rival , citigroup , gets half its revenues from consumer businesses .
' ' the timing of the merger was bad , ' ' said steven wharton , a banking analyst at loomis , sayles donald h . layton , one of two leaders of investment banking ; and james b . lee jr . , the bank ' s senior deal maker . the team also includes dina dublon , the bank ' s chief financial officer .
two other senior executives have also lived through big deals . geoffrey t . boisi , the other investment banking leader , was the one - time investment banking chief at goldman , sachs . david a . coulter , in charge of chase ' s retail bank , had been chief executive of bank of america before it was bought by nationsbank .
' ' there aren ' t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as bill harrison and his team , ' ' said mark g . solow , managing principal at garmark advisors , an investment firm , and a former senior executive at chemical .
still , ms . dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the j . p . morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations .
' ' in general , mergers are very hard on morale , ' ' she said . ' ' there is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll . ' '
the bank ' s executives are making the best of a bad situation . they have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks ' staff , or about 2 , 500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced .
many of these job cuts were aimed at high - cost investment bankers : j . p . morgan chase expects that 6 , 000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year .
' ' we have focused on the tougher jobs to cut , ' ' ms . dublon said .
in some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for j . p . morgan chase to overhaul its staff . with fewer jobs available on wall street , mr . shapiro said , the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs . ' ' people have fewer options , ' ' he said , ' ' so you have a little more control over the process . ' '
thanks partly to these cuts , the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be $ 3 . 6 billion annually , compared with an original projection of $ 2 billion at the time of the merger .
the cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank ' s core businesses . ' ' what we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company , ' ' ms . dublon said in a conference call with reporters on oct . 17 , the day earnings were announced .
aside from cost cuts , the weakness on wall street makes it hard for the bank ' s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking , where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter . but mr . harrison points to market - share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on wall street . he hopes that when the investment banking business revives , j . p . morgan chase will hold on to these gains .
the bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas : mergers and acquisitions , and the underwriting of large investment - grade bond deals .
the bank ranked 5 th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001 , up from chase ' s 12 th - place finish and j . p . morgan ' s 10 th - place standing during the same period last year , according to thomson financial securities data .
the merger and acquisitions business , which chase had been slowly building for years , is stronger following the merger with j . p . morgan , said mr . lee , a vice chairman at the bank . as a result , the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old chase only for loans .
mr . lee remains proud of the bank ' s work with enron , the energy company , despite its troubles . j . p . morgan chase , along with citigroup , raised $ 1 billion in bank financing for enron earlier this month . it was also hired to advise the company , which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by dynegy .
the old chase , long a lending powerhouse , would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing , but an advisory role would have been less certain . mr . lee said the investment banker advising enron came from the old j . p . morgan . but with merger activity slow , there are few such deals to go around .
the bank is also proud of its strength in long - term investment - grade bonds , another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger . it moved up to second place in that area so far this year , compared with sixth place a year ago .
the bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings , a surge driven by today ' s low interest rates . in may j . p . morgan chase raised $ 12 billion in bonds for worldcom , the telecommunications company , in the largest corporate debt deal in the united states on record .
unfortunately for j . p . morgan chase , the fees for underwriting investment - grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock , where j . p . morgan chase remains a second - tier competitor .
the bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock , falling to 9 th place this year , compared with the old j . p . morgan ' s 6 th - place finish a year ago . ( chase was 11 th . )
mr . harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business . ' ' we think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five , ' ' he said .
given the slowdown , some bankers predict that mr . harrison will ultimately do another deal , either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking , like the equity division .
' ' the general view is that the combination with j . p . morgan didn ' t do enough , ' ' one investment banker said .
mr . harrison disagrees : ' ' i don ' t feel , ' ' he said , ' ' we need to do another large deal to be successful . ' '
photo : william b . harrison jr . , the chief executive , says he has no doubts about the wisdom of forming j . p . morgan chase , even though the the economy has slowed since then . ' ' i can ' t tell you how happy i am about having done this merger , ' ' he said . ( associated press ) chart : ' ' still looking for the right mix ' ' when j . p . morgan and chase announced their merger in september 2000 , the combination ' s strength in investment banking seemed sure to be successful . but the bank ' s stock has suffered with wall street ' s slump , and its more consumer - oriented and better - diversified rival , citigroup , has fared better . graph tracks the daily closing prices of citigroup and j . p . morgan chase shares from september 2000 through november 2001 . a different blend of banking based on revenue , before overhead expenses ( first nine months of 2001 ) . j . p . morgan chase * consumer and small business : 32 % investment management and private : 9 % corporate and investment : 58 % citigroup consumer and small business : 54 % investment management and private : 4 % corporate and investment : 42 % * does not add to 100 because of rounding .

companies & finance the americas - enron ' awaiting ' capital injections , say officials .

( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved
officials working to shore up enron ' s balance sheet yesterday said the struggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than $ 1 . 5 bn as early as next week .
enron is in talks about $ 250 m investments with jp morgan chase and citigroup and is also hoping to raise at least $ 1 bn from private equity investors .
people close to enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish to invest in enron . however , the blackstone group , which was reported to be talking to the company before dynegy made its $ 9 bn rescue bid , is understood no longer to be doing so .
members of the 20 - strong bank lending group , led by jp morgan chase and citigroup , are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt until after the completion of the merger .
the moves comes as reports from goldman sachs and fitch , the credit rating agency , raised questions about the company ' s cash flow and its medium - term viability .
david fleischer , a goldman sachs analyst , argued that cash balances were inadequate to meet $ 2 . 8 bn of debt obligations falling due before the end of the year .
people close to enron say that nearly $ 1 bn of that debt has already been restructured .
the fitch report said that if the dynegy deal was not completed , enron would struggle to meet $ 9 bn of obligations due before the end of next year .
people close to enron insisted that dynegy remained committed to the merger and played down talk of renegotiation .
dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the deal , they predicted .

houston , nov 23 ( reuters ) - a long weekend of work faced dynegy inc . and proposed acquisition enron corp . , , whose worsening stock woes on friday whipped up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely .
houston - based dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross - town rival enron ' s complex books , as both parties race against the decline in enron ' s stock to complete the thorough financial examinations a merger requires .
enron shares ended down more than 5 percent , or 27 cents , to $ 4 . 74 at the close of abbreviated friday trading on the new york stock exchange . dynegy shares closed up 64 cents , or 1 . 61 percent , to $ 40 . 40 .
dynegy on nov . 9 agreed to pay about $ 9 billion in stock for enron . but , after falling 45 percent by friday ' s close amid fears it could run out of cash before the deal closes , enron ' s market capitalization is only about $ 4 . 03 billion .
at dynegy ' s current stock price , its offer for enron is worth about $ 10 . 85 a share - more than twice enron ' s current share price .
executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the review , known as due diligence , sources familiar with the matter told reuters . the sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of friday afternoon , and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence review is finished .
but should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a "" material adverse change "" in enron ' s business , the likelihood increases of dynegy invoking escape clauses or renegotiating , analysts and observers say .
"" you ' ve got to believe there is that possibility . there is a 90 percent spread on the deal , "" said one analyst . "" there ' s unquestionably continued malaise in enron ' s core business and dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with enron . ""
ubs warburg analyst ron barone on wednesday wrote in a research report that the likelihood was "" soaring "" that dynegy might discover a material adverse change .
enron spokeswoman karen denne said that , to her knowledge , dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition .
she repeated that enron was working on obtaining an additional $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet .
dynegy spokesman john sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the company remains optimistic about the merger .
traders fearing renegotiation
enron ' s recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel of enron that dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth - quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability . continued losses there would remove a key attraction for dynegy .
electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more likely that dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely , a move they said would leave enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy .
this week rating agency fitch investors said that if dynegy stepped away from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy filing was highly possible .
traders , speaking on condition on anonymity , said they expected dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap . enron ' s depleted market value and the shrinking volume in its enrononline trading system makes it more likely dynegy could pull out , traders said .
meanwhile , energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long - term deals with enron unless they received substantial assurances the company ' s credit rating would soon improve .
enron ' s bonds on friday were again talked at junk - bond levels , but even lower than before .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6 . 75 percent notes were bid friday at 57 cents on the dollar , down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on wednesday , according to a trader . the notes yield to maturity a respective 21 . 5 percent and 17 percent . its 20 - year zero - coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents .
enron is hovering at the edge of investment - grade as the three main credit trading agencies consider whether to cut them again , and some observers wonder how enron has avoided it .
"" a bond trading in the 50 s has nothing to do with an investment - grade security , "" said scott smith , a principal at wells capital management in san francisco , where he invests $ 6 billion in debt and does not own enron .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 23 ( reuters ) - it is rare that holding onto investment - grade credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered energy trader enron corp . , and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk status is taking so long .
"" the sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds , "" said scott smith , a principal at wells capital management in san francisco , where he invests $ 6 billion in debt , and does not own enron . "" a bond trading in the 50 s has nothing to do with an investment - grade security . ""
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6 . 75 percent notes were bid friday at 57 cents on the dollar , down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on wednesday , a trader said . the notes yield to maturity 21 . 5 percent and 17 percent .
meanwhile , enron ' s shares have sunk 94 percent this year . since october 16 , when it released third - quarter results , which it has since revised downward , its shares have fallen 86 percent , and its bonds by nearly half .
houston - based enron , which is trying to merge with smaller cross - town rival dynegy inc . , has been rocked this year by accounting problems , earnings restatements , a federal investigation and a top management shuffle .
its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company ' s books , which could lead to a renegotiation of the merger , sources familiar with the matter said .
moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s have cut its senior unsecured debt ratings twice in the last month to their current "" baa 3 "" and "" bbb - minus , "" their lowest investment grades . fitch has cut its equivalent rating to "" bbb - minus , "" and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts .
the stakes could hardly be higher .
cash crunch
a downgrade to "" junk "" status could imperil enron ' s trading business , force it to pay off as much as $ 3 . 9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts , and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection , analysts said .
enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $ 2 billion of available cash and credit lines .
s & p said on tuesday that enron faces "" liquidity issues , "" but enjoys an "" alignment of interests "" with its banks and a near - term financial position that "" is expected to be sufficient "" to allow the dynegy merger .
fitch , meanwhile , said on wednesday that "" our present ' bbb - minus ' rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks . ""
if dynegy walks away , it said , "" enron ' s credit situation seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible . ""
enron said on monday it had $ 9 . 15 billion of obligations due through next year , and a $ 690 million note that could come due next tuesday . it later said it got a three - week reprieve .
investment banks
sean egan , managing director of egan - jones ratings co . in philadelphia , likened enron ' s ratings situation to those of california ' s two largest utilities , pacific gas & electric co . and southern california edison .
despite investor unease , those utilities kept their investment - grade ratings only until they defaulted on debt in january , as california ' s power crisis worsened .
on november 8 , a day before the dynegy merger was announced , senior officials from enron ' s lead banks - william harrison , chief executive of j . p . morgan chase & co . , and michael carpenter , who runs citigroup inc . ' s investment banking arm - met with moody ' s to help allay that agency ' s concerns , a person familiar with the meeting said .
a day later , moody ' s , which issued no statement on enron this week , downgraded the company ' s senior unsecured debt rating , but only to its current "" baa 3 . ""
"" pressure is coming from the investment banks , which have a vested interest in seeing the dynegy deal go through , "" said egan , whose agency rates enron ' s debt "" bb , "" its second - highest junk grade . "" investment banking fees will be substantial . ""
companies pay for moody ' s and s & p ratings , which they need to obtain financing . egan said his agency receives no such payments .
citigroup and j . p . morgan declined to comment . moody ' s and s & p did not immediately return phone calls . fitch was not immediately available for comment . dynegy and enron on wednesday , however , reaffirmed their commitment to the merger .
wells capital ' s smith isn ' t sure what to expect .
"" enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed goes through , . . . but there are half a dozen things that could go wrong , "" he said . "" obviously , the equity markets are telling you it ' s very skeptical the merger will go through , and the bond market is following its lead . ""

usa : us corp bonds - enron slips again in quiet market .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 23 ( reuters ) - the u . s . corporate bond market saw very little activity on friday , with many traders leaving even in advance of the early close , though enron corp . ' s bonds weakened for a third straight session amid concern over the energy trader ' s liquidity , and whether its merger with dynegy inc . can go through .
"" deadly "" was how one trader described activity . spreads , the yield difference between investment - grade bonds and comparable maturity u . s . treasuries , finished unchanged on balance , as did junk bond prices , traders said .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6 . 75 percent notes were bid at 57 cents on the dollar , down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on wednesday , according to a trader . the notes yield to maturity a respective 21 . 5 percent and 17 percent . its 20 - year zero - coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents .
meanwhile , enron ' s shares fell 5 . 4 percent , as its advisers prepared this weekend to pore over the company ' s books , sources familiar with the matter said . analysts said there could be a renegotiation of the dynegy merger .
"" the sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds , "" said scott smith , a principal at wells capital management in san francisco , where he invests $ 6 billion of debt , none from enron . "" a bond trading in the 50 s has nothing to do with an investment - grade security . ""
ten - year treasuries closed down 12 / 32 , as their yields rose to 5 . 011 percent .
junk bond funds enjoy inflows
separately , investors poured cash into u . s . junk bond mutual funds for a second straight week amid a newfound tolerance for riskier assets .
investors added a net $ 628 . 5 million of cash to the funds in the week ending tuesday , on top of $ 816 . 3 million in the prior week , according to amg data services .
the two - week inflow is the largest since the second and third week of january . the bonds rose more than 6 percent that month , according to merrill lynch & co .
"" financial markets have rallied on hopes that the economy will get better in the not - too - distant future , "" said jan hatzius , senior economist at goldman sachs & co . "" a lot of the optimism right now is hope rather than reality , but we should see signs of improvement in a month or two . ""
through thursday , junk bonds have returned 2 . 93 percent in november alone , beating all other bonds , and are up 4 . 71 percent this year , merrill lynch data show . the bonds still yield 7 . 98 percentage points more than treasuries , but that ' s down from 9 . 29 percentage points at the start of the month .
companies this week sold about $ 3 . 83 billion of investment - grade , $ 533 million of junk , and $ 3 . 3 billion of convertible debt . investors expect about three more weeks of overall active issuance before the usual year - end slowdown .

usa : enron shares seesaw on concerns over dynegy deal .
11 / 23 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 23 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . fluctuated wildly on friday morning , as concerns grew over rival dynegy inc . ' s $ 9 billion acquisition of the beleaguered energy trader .
enron shares were down 8 cents , or 1 . 6 percent , to $ 4 . 93 in friday morning trading on the new york stock exchange , after diving more than 8 percent earlier .
the shares are down because of talk that the terms of dynegy ' s deal with enron could be changed or that the deal could collapse .
dynegy originally agreed to pay about $ 9 billion in stock for enron . but , after falling 42 percent since then by wednesday ' s close , enron now sports a market capitalization of only about $ 4 . 26 billion .
in a report on wednesday , ronald barone , an analyst at ubs warburg , suggested that the deal ' s current exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 share of dynegy for each share of enron could well be readjusted .
he suggested that a much lower exchange ratio of 0 . 15 was more realistic .
"" you ' ve got to believe there is that possibility . there is a 90 percent spread on the deal , "" said one analyst , referring to a potential renegotiation .
"" there ' s unquestionably continued malaise in enron ' s core business and dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with enron , "" he continued .
some of enron ' s trading partners have scaled back their activity , causing that "" malaise . "" lower volumes at its trading business , which is the largest and most coveted portion of its operation , could cause fourth - quarter earnings to come in below expectations , enron has said .

enron woes may endanger plans for mozambique steel proj

maputo , mozambique ( ap ) - - the recent downturn in fortunes for u . s . energy company enron corp . ( ene ) may quash hopes for the construction of a natural gas - fueled factory to produce steel slabs for export in mozambique , officials said friday .
one of the largest companies in the u . s . , enron is struggling amid potentially new cash - flow and earnings problems . the houston - based company was to invest $ 1 . 1 billion in the maputo iron and steel project , a factory that once built , was expected to produce two million tons of steel slabs a year .
but mozambican prime minister pacoal mocumbi said that the government hoped that , "" enron ' s current difficulties will not lead to the cancellation of the project . ""
"" my government wants to know from enron what is going on so that we are not held hostage to a lack of information , "" mocumbi said .
no immediate comment was available from enron officials in mozambique .
the planned project is part of long - standing efforts to exploit vast natural gas reserves in mozambique and transport and sell the product into the industrial heartland of south africa .
mozambique has two massive gas fields : temane is operated by the u . s . ' s atlantic richfield co . , sasol of south africa , and zarara petroleum of dubai , while pande is operated by enron .

stockwatch enron down , dynegy up on lingering merger uncertainty
11 / 23 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp shares were lower , while dynegy inc was slightly higher in late morning trade on lingering uncertainty about their proposed merger following a news report that enron ' s sec filing last monday contained details that were not known to acquirer dynegy , dealers said .
at 11 . 15 am , enron shares were trading down 17 cents at 4 . 84 , a decline of 3 . 3 pct . dynegy was up 44 cents at 40 . 20 .
the djia was up 57 . 70 points at 9 , 892 . 86 . the s & p 500 was up 6 . 24 points at 1 , 143 . 27 . the nasdaq composite was up 11 . 94 points at 1 , 886 . 99
earlier , the wall street journal quoted an unnamed source as saying monday ' s sec filing contained information on the company which was unknown to proposed buyer dynegy .
dynegy representatives are planning to work through the weekend evaluating the significance of this information as part of their due diligence on enron , the paper said . it did not specify the nature of the information .
in the filing , enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due nov 27 .
on wednesday , the company said it had received an extension on the repayment until mid - december , which it said was enough time to restructure the debt .
the company also said it was in active talks with its creditors and expected to be able to restructure other debt and remain solvent long enough for the merger with dynegy to be completed .
dynegy welcomed the news and said it will push ahead in seeking regulatory approval for the merger . but investors are concerned that the constant surprises in restated earnings and revelations of liquidity problems at enron may cause dynegy to walk away from the deal .
ubs warburg analyst ronald barone lowered enron ' s fourth - quarter earnings per share estimate to a loss of 25 cents from earnings of 25 cents , arguing that its business will suffer until its liquidity problems are resolved .
the analyst cut his full year estimate to 1 . 10 usd from 1 . 60 usd and 2002 estimate to 75 cents from 1 . 65 cents .
if his figures prove to be correct , they would make dynegy ' s current merger exchange terms - - of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share owned - - moderately dilutive .
"" we reiterate that if the merger with dynegy were to run into obstacles ( or fall through entirely ) enron shares could come under severe pressure as investors may question its ability to sustain liquidity ( and normal business activities ) for an extended period of time , "" barone said in a note . "" under such a scenario , bankruptcy would not be out of the question . ""
credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer was more upbeat , and said the share ' s decline in recent sessions has been overdone .
"" our industry contacts and discussions with traders indicate that while trading with enron has slowed , it certainly has not stopped , "" said launer .
for dynegy , the merger with enron still "" represents a dramatic plus , "" he said .

usa : houston economy seen weathering major layoffs .
by ellen chang
11 / 23 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 23 ( reuters ) - houston ' s economy , buffered by a broad and diverse tax base , should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of the city ' s major corporations , including energy powerhouse enron corp . , economists and analysts said .
financially ailing enron corp . , which has 21 , 000 employees worldwide and is in talks to be bought by houston - based rival dynegy inc . , is the third major employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent months . analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs .
continental announced a layoff of 3 , 000 employees after the sept . 11 attacks and hewlett - packard co . ' s plan to buy compaq computer corp . will , if finalized , result in 15 , 000 layoffs at the two companies . compaq also announced 8 , 000 layoffs worldwide in july .
"" it ' s fair to say that the potential layoffs at enron and the layoffs at continental , taken alone , are negative factors , although probably small in the grand scope of the houston economy , "" said phil scheps , director of houston ' s finance and administration department .
since last month when enron became a target of a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships , the energy giant ' s market share has steadily eroded .
while neither enron nor dynegy have given any indication of the number of layoffs that could hit houston , barton smith , director of the institute for regional forecasting at the university of houston , said the layoffs "" will be spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive . ""
robin kapiloff , an analyst at moody ' s investors service , said the city ' s efforts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenue collections , even as some of the city ' s biggest employers suffer . "" we ' re watching to see where things go now , "" she said .
alex fraser , a director at standard & poor ' s , said the ratings agency isn ' t concerned about houston ' s credit position at this point . "" while enron is certainly a large player and prominent corporation , we ' re unclear on what the impact would be . ""
while the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdown since the sept . 11 attacks , houston has outperformed the rest of the nation .
with a tax base of $ 87 . 3 billion in 2001 , houston is also buffered by the texas medical center , the city ' s largest employer . next year the city ' s tax base is estimated to grow to $ 95 billion .
still , the national recession , energy price weakness in general , and the initial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the city to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1 . 5 percent from 5 percent . that revised estimate equals a $ 13 million reduction in the city ' s $ 1 . 4 billion budget .
but the city ' s property tax revenue has not been affected . only a small change in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are based on jan . 1 data and for most of 2001 , real estate growth was very large , scheps said .
while recent economic indicators appear positive , and consumer confidence has quickly rebounded , a better read on the strength of houston ' s tax revenue collections will be available in february when the city receives data for the december holiday season , scheps said .

new york ( afx ) - monday ' s sec filing by enron ' s corp contained information that proposed buyer dynegy inc had not known about , the wall street journal quoted a person familiar with the merger plans as saying .
dynegy representatives plan to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company ' s due diligence on enron , the source said , without specifying what the new information was .
in the filing , enron disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars of potential additional write - offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than 2 bln usd in loans by the end of the year .
dynegy announced wednesday that it is working to accelerate regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition in accordance with the previously announced agreement .
the journal quoted analysts as saying dynegy is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the deal .
it also cited fitch director ralph pellecchia as saying that , without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers , an enron bankruptcy - court filing "" is highly possible "" .

dynegy ' s decision to buy enron hits crossroads amid rising financial woes
11 / 23 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
even as it reiterated its intention to purchase enron corp . , dynegy inc . is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion - dollar deal , friday ' s wall street journal reported .
the pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of enron ( ene ) shares and the mounting financial problems at the houston energy - trading company , the nation ' s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas . during the past month , enron has taken a $ 1 billion write - off of assets , revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .
the problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partnerships , run by some of its own executives , under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . in an sec filing monday , enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write - offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $ 2 billion in loans by the end of the year .
as of 4 p . m . wednesday in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares fell $ 1 . 98 , or 28 % , to $ 5 . 01 each after having dropped 23 % tuesday . in excess of 115 million shares traded wednesday , more than four times the volume of any other big board stock . enron ' s bonds also again traded sharply lower , market observers said .
the turmoil spilled over to dynegy ' s stock , which also was among the most actively traded on the new york stock exchange . as of 4 p . m . wednesday , dynegy ( dyn ) shares fell $ 1 . 94 to $ 39 . 76 each .
on wednesday , dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executive chuck watson said his company was working "" to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement "" though it continued to perform "" due diligence "" on enron .
under the merger agreement , dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if enron ' s financial and legal problems become severe enough . however , some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so - called material adverse change clauses . they point to a decision earlier this year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc . to complete a planned purchase of ibp inc . even though tyson , a springdale , ark . , food - products company , had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in ibp ' s earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit .
dynegy officials didn ' t return calls seeking comment . to complete the deal , two - thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders would have to give their approval . no dates for those votes have been set .
one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enron contained information dynegy hadn ' t known about . dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company ' s due diligence , this person said . it couldn ' t be determined what the new information was .
the merger agreement , announced nov . 9 , calls for dynegy to exchange 0 . 2685 share for each of enron ' s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares , giving the purchase a value of about $ 9 billion at dynegy ' s current stock price . however , from a price standpoint , the deal is appearing less attractive to dynegy .
on the day of the merger announcement , enron shares were trading at about $ 8 . 63 each , or about 83 % of the purchase price under the exchange ratio . as of wednesday , enron ' s market price was only about 47 % of the merger - formula price . such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement , when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price .
sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger . initially , many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron and provide a major boost to houston - based dynegy . dynegy and enron officials have predicted that the merger , supposed to be completed late next year , would significantly and immediately increase dynegy ' s earnings .
now analysts are challenging that assumption . ron barone , managing director at ubs warburg llc , said he believes that because of enron ' s financial problems , a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than dynegy would have by itself . mr . barone said he thinks a "" likely scenario "" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 . 15 dynegy share for each enron share .

employees ' lawuit says enron hurt retirement funds courts : the suit claims the energy firm urged workers to invest in company stock just before it plunged .

houston - - two enron corp . workers are suing the company , claiming it endangered their retirement funds .
the lawsuit , filed in federal court in houston under the employee retirement income security act , asserts that enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked . the lawsuit was filed by portland , ore . , utility lineman roy rinard and co - worker steve lacey .
enron shares have plunged more than 90 % over the last several months since the departure of the company ' s chief executive and an accounting controversy that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997 , eliminating more than $ 580 million of reported income .
steve berman , managing partner for the law firm of hagens berman in seattle , said enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into enron stock .
enron officials didn ' t emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive , especially when the company ' s stock began to slide , said berman , who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action .
berman wants to prove that the company ' s 401 ( k ) plan executives failed to act responsibly when they knew about serious business problems . he ' s also hoping to break new legal ground with his case .
the lawsuit is patterned after a case against lucent technologies in which lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401 ( k ) contributions with company stock that tanked . that case is still in litigation .
earlier this year , rinard , 54 , had $ 472 , 000 in his enron 401 ( k ) plan , which had been growing for 21 years .
today , his plan is worth about $ 40 , 000 . enron gives its employees their 401 ( k ) match in company stock .
in january , enron was trading for $ 84 . 87 . wednesday it closed at $ 5 . 01 a share on the new york stock exchange .
the problem was compounded when many employees , including rinard , saw enron ' s stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into enron stock .
enron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb above $ 100 a share , rinard told the houston chronicle .
in addition , enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401 ( k ) plan for about a month , starting oct . 17 . that was the day after enron surprised the market with the news it was taking a $ 1 . 01 - billion after - tax third - quarter charge to get out of bad investments .
enron officials , who could not be reached , have said they had planned the lockdown for several months because the company was changing plan administrators .

portland utility ' s fate tied to enron ' s future

los angeles - - oregon ' s largest utility , portland general electric , faces an uncertain future as its parent enron fights for its life amid a deepening financial crisis , industry experts said wednesday .
another oregon utility , northwest natural gas , is due to file next week with state regulators for approval to take over portland general . those same regulators could soon be faced with a similar application from dynegy as part of a still - pending deal to acquire cash - strapped enron .
if enron were to file for bankruptcy before portland general has been sold , its future could be thrown into the hands of a texas bankruptcy court , experts said .
northwest natural gas agreed oct . 8 to acquire portland general for around $ 1 . 8 billion , plus about $ 1 . 1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock . a month later , enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by houston - based dynegy .
"" we ' ve been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale ( portland general ' s acquisition by northwest natural gas ) , "" said roy hemmingway , chairman of the oregon public utility commission .
"" we have authority if that sale doesn ' t go through to rule on whether dynegy can take over enron , "" he said .
ratings agency fitch last week cut portland general ' s debt ratings due to "" uncertainty at its parent enron . "" wednesday , the same agency said a bankruptcy filing by enron was "" highly possible "" if the proposed rescue by dynegy collapses .
"" we haven ' t seen any credit problems so far , and portland general isn ' t in the market ( buying power for its customers ) right now in a big way , "" hemmingway said .
however , he noted that , "" if they really were unable to conduct their business because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instruments are available "" to make sure service to customers is maintained . earlier this year , california was forced to take over buying power for the pg & e unit of pacific gas & electric and edison international subsidiary southern california edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to junk status .
federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the right to sell to a creditworthy buyer .
california ' s largest utility , pacific gas & electric , chose to file for bankruptcy because of its mounting debt . in a parallel , consumer advocates fear the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring oregon could end up in the hands of a bankruptcy judge .
hemmingway said the oregon public utility commission recently had granted portland general a rate increase and the utility has "" plenty of cash flow currently to handle its obligations . ""
"" this is nothing like california where that was not the case , "" he said .
northwest natural gas , which is also based in portland , has set a target of filing next wednesday with the oregon commission to take over the utility , spokesman steve sechrist said .
"" we have no concerns whatsoever at this point . the deal is moving forward and there is no reason we can see why it should not "" he said , noting the delay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition .
jason eisdorfer , a lawyer for the citizens ' utility board of oregon , said major questions would be raised if enron went under before the deal were completed .
"" would the ( bankruptcy ) judge let the terms of the agreement go forward . i don ' t know . there is a risk that portland general will become an asset to be disposed of under bankruptcy , "" eisdorfer said .

enron shares and bonds fall on concern about takeover ( update 5 )
2001 - 11 - 23 15 : 55 ( new york )
enron shares and bonds fall on concern about takeover ( update 5 )
( updates with dynegy comment in fifth paragraph . )
houston , nov . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares and bonds
fell for a third day on concern the company ' s weakened financial
condition and plunging stock price may lead dynegy inc . to try to
cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader .
shares of enron , the most - active u . s . stock , dropped
30 cents , or 6 percent , to $ 4 . 71 . they fell 45 percent tuesday and
wednesday after enron said it may have to pay more than $ 9 billion
in debt due by 2003 . enron 6 . 4 percent bonds due in july 2006 were
bid at 55 cents on the dollar , down from 62 cents on wednesday ,
traders said .
enron shares are trading at less than half the value of
dynegy ' s offer , which shows investors are questioning whether the
buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago .
enron ' s financial woes may prove to be a drag on dynegy ' s earnings
next year if the transaction is completed , analysts said .
` ` there are continued doubts about the deal , ' ' said ubs
warburg analyst ronald barone , who rates dynegy a ` ` strong buy ' '
and doesn ' t own shares in either company . ` ` enron ' s earnings
aren ' t what they used to be because they ' ve lost trading business .
given that , dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price . ' '
dynegy spokesman john sousa said the company ` ` remains
optimistic for the potential of the merger . ' ' enron agreed nov . 9
to the takeover , now valued at about $ 23 billion in stock and
assumed debt , after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy .
on wednesday , enron got a three - week reprieve from lenders on
a $ 690 million note due next week , giving the company more time to
restructure its finances . dynegy chief executive officer chuck
watson said he was ` ` encouraged ' ' by the commitment to extend the
note payment , as well as the closing of a $ 450 million credit
facility , and that dynegy remained committed to the purchase .
more than 40 million enron shares changed hands today , almost
twice their three - month daily average , in a session shortened
because of the thanksgiving holiday . enron was the most - active
u . s . stock on wednesday , with 116 million shares traded . dynegy
shares rose 64 cents to $ 40 . 40 today .
less than $ 2 billion
in a securities & exchange commission filing monday , enron
said it has less than $ 2 billion in cash and credit lines left . if
the company ' s cash reserves run too low , enron is in danger of
seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade . that would
trigger $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated
partnerships .
enron ' s bankers have met with unidentified investors ,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies , in
a bid to shore up the energy trader ' s finances with an injection
of as much as $ 2 billion , the new york times reported yesterday ,
citing unidentified executives close to the companies .
enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company is seeking
$ 500 million to $ 1 billion . enron needs to raise $ 1 billion to
$ 1 . 5 billion in cash within the next 45 days , said sean egan ,
managing director of egan - jones rating co .
` ` their trading operation has burned through cash faster than
the market had expected , ' ' egan said .
trading business
traders including mirant corp . and aquila inc . have said they
shifted transactions away from enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness . enron has said
fourth - quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its
energy - trading business .
watson said after the enron buyout was announced he expected
it to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent . analysts said that
can ' t happen unless enron recovers lost trading business . several
have cut their 2002 estimates for enron . the average estimate of
analysts polled by thomson financial / first call for next year is
now $ 1 . 68 a share , down from $ 2 . 14 a month ago .
dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if enron can ' t meet debt
payments , its trading market collapses , banks demand more
collateral or raise the interest rate for loans , enron ' s credit
rating is cut to junk , the sec cites enron for securities fraud ,
or if enron ' s legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed
$ 3 . 5 billion , egan said .
will dynegy renegotiate ?
dynegy officials were considering whether to try and
renegotiate terms of its agreement with enron , according to the
new york times report . dynegy and enron are both based in houston .
` ` dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a
lower price for enron , ' ' said credit lyonnais securities analyst
gordon howald , who rates dynegy ` ` buy ' ' and owns no shares .
under the nov . 9 terms , enron investors would receive 0 . 2685
dynegy share for each share held . at today ' s closing price , that
values enron stock at $ 10 . 85 . a year ago , enron traded at almost
$ 80 .
investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push
enron into bankruptcy .
` ` the market is saying there seems to be no obvious plan b
for enron and that is what has investors concerned , ' ' said eric
bergson , who helps manage $ 9 billion of fixed - income assets at
northern trust co . in chicago . ` ` the lower bond prices go , what
the market is saying is that there ' s less chance of this deal
going through . ' '

kkr , blackstone are among likely enron investors , analyst says
2001 - 11 - 23 16 : 20 ( new york )
kkr , blackstone are among likely enron investors , analyst says
houston , nov . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - kohlberg , kravis roberts &
co . , the blackstone group and the carlyle group are among the
likely candidates to be approached by enron corp . for a private
equity investment to shore up the company ' s balance sheet , said
industry analyst david snow of . net .
the firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy
companies in the past . an investment in enron may look attractive
now that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year .
` ` many of the larger , more traditional buyout firms would
find this deal attractive , ' ' said snow . ` ` this is a company that
has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital
when capital is scarce . ' '
enron ' s bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and
two industrial companies to seek an investment , the new york times
reported , citing executives close to the companies . enron ' s stock
fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company ' s weakened
financial condition may lead dynegy inc . to try to cancel or
rework its planned purchase of the rival houston company .
investors may inject as much as $ 2 billion under arrangements
that would protect them from further declines in enron ' s stock ,
the times said . the new investments would be in enron ' s
transwestern pipeline , which connects natural - gas fields in texas
to the california market , the newspaper said .
j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . agreed to terms
that give each of them a $ 250 million equity stake as part of a
transaction to be completed monday , officials told the newspaper .
buyout firms sometimes make collective bids , pooling their
money and distributing the risk . the firms also like to invest in
industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do
so in partnership with corporate investors , like dynegy , said
snow .
` ` you need to know enough about the ( energy ) business to know
whether it ' s a good deal , and then you need to be confident in the
dynegy team , ' ' he said .
kkr
kkr , the second - biggest private equity firm with $ 24 billion
in assets , declined comment on enron through spokeswoman molly
morse of kekst & co .
the new york - based firm invested more than $ 1 . 3 billion in
dpl inc . , a utility in dayton , ohio , and will receive $ 550 million
of that back from the company after dpl sold $ 700 million of bonds
in august .
` ` kkr very much gets involved in deals where there ' s a
corporate partner and they don ' t have a majority stake , ' ' snow
said . ` ` they would possibly hold it for years , because they like
slow exits . ' ' kkr is also a possible candidate because it recently
raised a new $ 5 billion buyout fund .
any lbo firm would need assurance about how it will get its
money back on an enron investment , said snow .
` ` the thing they have to be cautious about is the exit , ' ' he
said . ` ` if there ' s a chance dynegy would agree to buy out ( the lbo
firms ' ) stake over time , that would give some confidence . but if
the only exit is the public market , that ' s a little bit dicier . ' '
any private investment also must be large enough to make a
meaningful difference : enron ' s market value is $ 3 . 7 billion and
dynegy has proposed paying $ 23 billion in stock and assumption of
debt . that means the private equity portion would have to approach
$ 1 billion or more .
the 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than
$ 5 billion under management each , according to asset alternatives ,
a wellesley , massachusetts industry research firm . still , many of
those firms don ' t have enough free capital to undertake an
investment of $ 500 million or more .
an announcement of an investment may come soon , analysts say .
energy trading firms such as mirant corp . and aquila inc . are
doing fewer trades with enron because of concern that the company
won ' t be able to finance its business . enron shares have fallen by
almost half in the past three sessions .
` ` they ' re going to need this investment within 30 to 45
days , ' ' said sean egan of egan - jones ratings co . ` ` they ' re
spiraling downward and they ' re going to need some more beyond the
$ 1 . 5 billion contributed by ' ' chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26
percent of dynegy .
other lbos
here ' s a rundown of the other most likely private equity
partners for enron :
- - the carlyle group could invest through a $ 1 billion energy
fund it ' s raising , as well as its general u . s . buyout fund , said
snow . carlyle ' s vice president for corporate communications , chris
ullman , declined to comment .
- - blackstone , which has a history of investing alongside
other corporate partners , recently closed on a $ 4 billion buyout
fund . blackstone spokesman john ford declined to comment on
whether enron had approached the firm .
- - hicks , muse , tate & furst , which is based in texas like
dynegy and enron . hicks muse counts triton energy ltd . , an energy
exploration company , among its best investments . the firm recently
raised about $ 1 . 5 billion for new investments , about one - third of
what it had hoped to raise , and has said it will focus on ` ` back -
to - basics ' ' investments in food , manufacturing and media . mark
semer , a spokesman for hicks muse who also works for kekst ,
declined comment on enron .
spokesmen for two other firms , warburg pincus & co . and
credit suisse first boston ' s private equity arm , didn ' t return
calls seeking comment .

microsoft msn fast web access expansion slowed by enron suit
2001 - 11 - 23 11 : 59 ( new york )
microsoft msn fast web access expansion slowed by enron suit
redmond , washington nov . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - microsoft corp . ' s
plans to expand its msn high - speed internet service have been
delayed by a lawsuit from enron corp . , which could cost the
company customers during the holiday season , analysts said .
msn had planned to have fast internet access over telephone
lines available , with help from energy trader enron , in 45 markets
starting oct . 25 . instead , the service is now on sale in about 30
markets , said msn product manager lisa gurry .
the latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that
has delayed the rollout of microsoft ' s fast internet access
service over the last year . the holidays are typically a popular
time for customers to buy so - called broadband access , often along
with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts .
` ` they have a track record of picking broadband partners that
don ' t quite work out , ' ' said joe laszlo , senior analyst at market
researcher jupiter media metrix inc . ` ` it definitely hurts them
with customers who want broadband right now . ' '
subscribers to fast internet access services are expected to
grow fourfold by 2006 , according to estimates by jupiter media
metrix , while sales of slower internet access plans decline . fast
internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line , or
dsl , technology .
on track
gurry said redmond , washington - based microsoft is still on
track to have fast access for sale by the end of march to 90
percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have dsl
available in their neighborhoods .
` ` there is very little growth left in the dial - up access
space for microsoft or anybody , which leaves them with broadband
as the only potential growth area for the msn access business , ' '
said youssef squali , an analyst at fac / equities , who rates
microsoft internet competitor aol time warner inc . a ` ` buy . ' '
microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music
and video and software updates , which require fast internet access
for smooth downloads .
the company originally began a service with northpoint
communications group inc . , a now - bankrupt provider of fast web
access . microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among
cable companies who use their networks for high - speed service .
now houston - based enron , which agreed in june to provide the
backbone for a nationwide expansion of msn ' s service , is suing .
enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn ' t required to deliver
broadband services if microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing
and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to
build .
enron , which is being acquired by rival dynegy inc . , recently
disclosed debts of $ 9 . 15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings
for four years .
slower expansion
msn has been selling high - speed access in 14 states under
partnership with qwest communications international inc . for the
last few months . msn has begun the planned service expansion
outside of those states by working with enron competitors that msn
marketing director bob visse declined to name . the company is also
talking to enron , he said . enron didn ' t return calls for comment .
because of the enron suit the expansion is moving slower than
expected , visse said . since oct . 25 , msn has added service in los
angeles , san francisco , san diego and sacramento , california , and
houston , dallas , san antonio and austin , texas , giving microsoft a
total of about 30 markets rather than 45 . plans to expand
marketing are also on hold , visse said .
` ` it is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are
in , ' ' said microsoft chief executive steve ballmer .
top u . s . internet service provider america online , owned by
aol time warner inc . , has also been slow to get into the high -
speed market , analysts said .
that doesn ' t mean microsoft is in the clear . laszlo said both
msn and aol might pay for their sluggishness with tougher
competition from third - place earthlink inc . and from cable and
telephone companies that have more experience selling high - speed
internet access .
america online has more than 31 million subscribers to msn ' s
7 million . earthlink inc . has 4 . 77 million subscribers . laszlo
doesn ' t think msn or america online can build the kind of lead in
the high - speed market that america online has in the slower dial -
up access market .
` not a permanent blow '
not that anyone need worry about microsoft . msn will be able
to expand its fast internet access business even with the delays ,
laszlo said .
` ` they are already late in the broadband market so this means
they get a little later , ' ' he said . ` ` but broadband will continue
to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a
permanent blow . ' '
analysts also say microsoft still needs to find a cable
partner that will let msn use its network to sell fast access over
cable lines . cable is more popular than dsl with customers looking
for fast web service . the five largest cable providers control 51
percent of the u . s . high - speed internet market . the five largest
sellers of access via phone lines and dsl technology account for
about 33 percent , according to market researcher ars inc .
microsoft msn vice president yusuf mehdi said last month the
company may be interested in an investment in at & t corp . ' s cable -
television unit , which at section a

"Subject: re : replacement cost values
the 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $ 670 , 000 based upon ena ' s 2001 reported value of approximately $ 470 , 000 , 000 . the pro - rata credit for 7 months , assuming a 5 - 31 - 01 sale date , would be $ 390 , 833 .
underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal . gathering these values within enron normally requires 30 to 45 days . we use these same values in the allocation system . unless the value change is significant , the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values , we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted .
if we internally adjust your allocation mid - year , we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program . as you know , the remainder of enron did not stand still while you sold bammel . we have not tried this before , however , i suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ena ' s allocation , all the other operating entities would want to re - submit their revised values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment . in view of the time required , this is neither practical nor cost effective for enron . in view of the relatively small numbers , i doubt that corp . would entertain this proposition either , however , we can approach them if you wish .

subject : re : replacement cost values
brian :
this insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage . values are adjusted annually at renewal . the premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds . in the event that we discontinue premiums to north america for hlp , we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured . in the event of a significant divestiture , underwriters may consider a refund , however , the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to enron ' s values as a whole . additionally , enron ' s adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures .
at renewal , 4 / 01 / 02 , north america ' s revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of enron ' s overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of enron .

in addition to the 188 , 371 , 296 property value for bammel lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for bammel gas storage of 267 , 000 , 000 . requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with aep not enron and thus the 2002 plan premium allocations of $ 754 , 096 on the bammel gas storage 267 , 000 , 000 value and $ 924 , 433 on the bammel lease value of 188 , 371 , 296 should not be needed .

as we discussed , the following is a list of diligence items that we would
like to explore further . this list is not all inclusive and we may need to
discuss additional items as we continue with due diligence . please let me
know when we could meet to discuss them further . kevin and i had
tentatively scheduled a november 28 , 2001 meeting to discuss development of
purchase and sale agreements and possibly some of the items listed below :
assuming that the megs system includes the riser and topside equipment
on marathon ' s sp 89 platform , we will need verify potential liability for
the same and any agreements addressing such access . we would also like
to review the production handling agreement between burlington / mariner
and marathon to verify the impact it may have on the future operation of
the system
we will need a definitive representation from enron as to the status of
the producers committment obligations as of december 1 , 2001 as defined
in the gathering agreements , including any credits due from prior years
excess flows . it is our understanding that for the month of december
there will be a $ 93 , 000 credit to the payment due gatherer and there are
no credits due in 2002 .
in the gathering agreement "" project payout "" is referenced from the
producer ' s joa . please provide verification that this payout has
occured , the ownership percentage is now 51 % mariner and 49 % burlington
and that there is no future change that could affect the megs agreements
need to review sample invoices , sample gas and condensate measurement
statements and demonstration of timely payment of such invoices by

simplified the valuation of the hourly swings .
obviously , in case of a problem , my reputation
and your esteem would be more valuable
than 30 % of 90 , 000 usd ( to be shared . . . )

hi
tony is a uk employee who starts next monday 12 th march 2001 , we have done a
quick start in nest today for him .
tony will be working his first month in the houston office , however we still
need to set up a log on and notes account here .
can you please send the log on and password for both accounts to kevin as he
will be meeting with tony on monday morning in the houston office .
tony will not have a desk arranged for him until he comes back in
approximately a month so no actual pc is necessary until then .
one question - with a uk log on and notes account , will tony be able to
access these from houston ? if it ' s complicated can you please let kevin know
how to do this .
any problems let me know
thanks

"Subject: new albany generator # 3 repair work
we have tentatively reached an arrangement with duke regarding the repair work . if closing takes place prior to completion of the repair work , duke will assume control of the repairs and enron will continue to pay actual invoices received in connection with the repair work so long as they are consistent with the agreed upon scope of work .
currently the estimated costs are $ 1 . 45 million ( these have increased slightly from our prior conversations because of new problems uncovered when the generator was opened up ) . we are reasonably certain that no further material problems should arise in the completion of the work and that the estimated cost is reasonable static .
on the insurance claim related to this work , i understand that the insurance company is balking at paying two components of the repair work which will likely ( if this is their final , unchallenged position ) result in the deductible exceeding the loss payable ( i . e . no insurance proceeds payable to ena ) .
please feel free to call with any questions .

will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand , believe me .
i am martin francis , a cote d  ivoire national and the
only child of late mr and mrs francis . my late father

telecommunication ( citelcom ) . my father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years . but , i am motherless since , before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 september 1993

member who hated her just because of my fathers

moreover , they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because god almighty
is available at our side . infact god is wonderful .
although , before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here , he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us $ 16 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( sixteen million , five
hundred thousand united states dollars ) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county abidjan ,
côte d  ivoire and used my name , martin francis as the
next of kin for the deposits . this amount was accrued
from an over - invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city ( yamoussoukro ) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father , mr joseph
francis in 1999 to expatiate companies . in fact , after
the finished payment of contract workers , my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company ( citelcom )
this is the fund i want to transferred to your account

you cooperate . therefore i am seeking your full and
urgent assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars , us $ 16 , 500 . 000 us dollars to your

4 . you have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education .
5 . you will have to be my guardian and part of the

20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund .
moreover , i wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next ( 3 ) days you signify
interest to assist me out . i suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because i have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund .

quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country côte -

what is the p luce , laura
subject : credit issues
rudwell - as you can probably imagine , we have had several counterparties with whom enovate has pending transactions that have initially claimed they will not accept enron ' s credit as part of the transaction . below is a list of those counterparties to date :
counterparty service term total value
wisconsin gas 10 day storage service 3 yrs ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 05 ) $ 1 , 100 , 000
wisconsin gas 50 day storage service 3 yrs ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 05 ) $ 3 , 375 , 000
wisconsin pub . svc 5 day storage service 4 months ( 11 / 10 / 01 - 3 / 10 / 02 ) $ 240 , 000
txu storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 990 , 000
we are also in the process of negotiating transactions with several other counterparties including oneok , pg & e , and pancanadian . they have not yet raised credit concerns .
it is obviously imperative that we keep business moving forward . in that regard , what has our response been to such denials of credit ? have we thought about posting l / c ' s or is that cost prohibitive ? we may have some flexibility with peoples posting credit , but that has certain legal implications and is limited . also , three of the above deals do not start until april so we may have some flexibility with timing . however , all of the above counterparties are anxious to put the contracting logistics behind them in case the deals fall through and they need to replace the service .
any thoughts and assistance on this effort is greatly appreciated .

new york , nov 20 ( reuters ) - enron corp . ' s debt ratings may still fall to junk status , standard & poor ' s said on tuesday , a day after the energy trading giant said it may have to pay off a $ 690 million note next week , and owes $ 9 . 15 billion in debt and other obligations by the end of 2002 .
s & p also said enron ' s near - term liquidity position is "" expected to be sufficient "" to allow it to merge with smaller houston - based rival dynegy inc . . the merger , announced this month , is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002 .
s & p , which said it may cut houston - based enron ' s "" bbb - minus "" and "" a - 3 "" long - and short - term unsecured debt ratings , each one notch above junk , said the chance enron will have to pay off the note raises "" liquidity issues , "" but that "" given the alignment of interests between enron and the banks , "" enron ' s ability to renegotiate the note "" will be successful . ""
enron said in its quarterly report , filed monday with the securities and exchange commission , that it has less than $ 2 billion of available cash and credit lines . it said in the filing the recent s & p downgrade to "" bbb - minus "" may force it to pay off the $ 690 million note by tuesday if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt of an affiliated partnership .
enron shares traded tuesday afternoon on the new york stock exchange at $ 6 . 99 , down $ 2 . 07 , or 22 . 9 percent , on volume topping 53 million shares . they have fallen more than 91 percent in 2001 amid accounting problems , earnings restatements , a federal investigation and management changes .

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - investors are running for the exits as doubts about enron corp . ' s ( ene ) planned merger with dynegy inc . ( dyn ) mount .
debt and equity markets are taking news of enron ' s never ending credit woes with renewed pessimism tuesday , sending the company ' s stock down almost 24 % and its bonds sharply lower .
and with so much riding on dynegy ' s financial support , risk arbitrageurs , those investors who bet on the stock price of companies involved in merger , aren ' t willing to play . "" there is just too much risk , "" said a trader at a new york risk arbitrage firm . "" nobody wants to even get close to the deal . ""
perhaps most telling about the uncertainty surrounding enron and the merger with dynegy is the fact that even a 68 % risk premium over the value of the dynegy deal has so far failed to attract investors . "" the deal appears in real jeopardy here , "" a bond trader said .
under the merger plan , enron holders would receive 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share . at dynegy ' s current share price of $ 41 . 77 , that means the value of the deal is about $ 11 . 20 a share for enron holders . but enron stock recently traded as low as $ 6 . 68 a share , almost 68 % below the value of the merger .
adding to doubts about enron ' s long - term viability , the company said in a delayed quarterly filing late monday that its ability to continue as a going concern depends on a number of factors , including being able to retain an investment grade credit rating .
dynegy declined to comment on whether its decision to merge with enron would be affected by the company ' s latest securities and exchange commission filing , including the disclosure that enron will have to repay $ 690 million in debt by next tuesday if it doesn ' t come up with collateral for a loan .
an enron spokeswoman wasn ' t available to comment on the merger plan .
among other bad news , enron ' s latest report warned investors that the company faces immediate demand for $ 3 . 9 billion in debt if its credit rating is downgraded any further .
earlier this month , standard & poor ' s corp . and moody ' s investors service cut enron ' s credit ratings to "" bbb - "" and "" baa 3 "" , just one notch higher than below - investment grade , or "" junk "" status . the rating agencies warned that they may cut their respective ratings again . neither s 201 - 938 - 2074 ; dow jones newswires

accounting watchdogs to examine auditors ' peer review process
2001 - 11 - 20 13 : 32 ( new york )
accounting watchdogs to examine auditors ' peer review process
washington , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - the accounting industry ' s
watchdog group plans to examine whether audit firms are conducting
adequate ` ` peer reviews ' ' of one another in light of arthur
andersen llp ' s failed audits of enron corp . , according to the
group ' s chairman , charles bowsher .
a detailed review of the enron case rests with the securities
and exchange commission , the public oversight board chairman said .
the board will look at the bigger issue , ` ` which is how can you
have peer reviews and still have these kinds of failures ? ' '
bowsher said .
the pob , a private group created to oversee the accounting
industry ' s self - governance as an advocate for the public , will
take the matter up at a closed meeting in washington on dec . 4 , he
said .
houston - based enron , the largest energy trader , earlier this
month reported that it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over
four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion
because of an ` ` accounting error , ' ' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
andersen , the world ' s fifth - largest accounting firm , served
as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring
investors that the company ' s financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles . the sec is investigating
some of enron ' s partnerships .
firms that audit public companies submit to ` ` peer reviews ' '
of their accounting practices by other accounting firms , a
practice aimed at assuring the investing public that the firm
complies with professional standards .
u . s . representative john dingell , a michigan democrat , said
yesterday in a letter to bowsher that none of the big five
accounting firms has ever issued a negative report against another
at the end of any peer review .
dingell skeptical
` ` there appears to be little reason for the public to have
faith in andersen or the peer review process , ' ' dingell wrote .
andersen responded saying it had faith in the accounting
profession ' s self - regulatory process , which the pob oversees .
a spokeswoman at deloitte & touche llp , andersen ' s peer -
reviewer , didn ' t return a telephone call seeking comment .
deloitte , the third - largest reviewer , is conducting a peer review
of andersen now .
bowsher , a former u . s . comptroller general , said the pob was
thinking of looking into peer review issues before receiving
dingell ' s letter .
` ` but this letter certainly focuses the issue , ' ' he said .
dingell ' s letter said the outside counsel to a special
committee of enron ' s board has retained deloitte & touche to help
it review the company ' s accounting problems .
conflict of interest ?
` ` do dt ' s dual roles create a conflict of interest ? ' '
dingell ' s letter asked . ` ` if dt finds numerous problems on enron ,
will dt try to ` whitewash ' or reconcile them in order to be able
to issue a clean peer review report ? ' '
dingell also questioned whether the money andersen pays
deloitte & touche for its current peer review will sway the
outcome .
` ` how will this influence , if at all , dt ' s ` independent '
judgment of andersen ' s work on enron ? ' ' the letter said .
bowsher responded : ` there ' s nothing we can do to change the
fact that deloitte & touche has done the previous reviews of
andersen . now , the question is should they ( the outside counsel )
use the same firm , or would it be better for them to use another
firm ? and that ' s pretty much their decision . ' '
bowsher said he has no knowledge of the accounting problems
at enron beyond what he ' s read in newspapers .
` ` it looks pretty bad , doesn ' t it ? , ' ' he said .
expanded power
dingell ' s request could prove a test of the pob ' s recently
expanded power and oversight . the group ' s charter was revised
earlier this year to make the pob the accounting industry ' s
premier watchdog group following criticisms by former sec chairman
arthur levitt and former sec chief accountant lynn turner . they
criticized the ` ` alphabet soup ' ' of accounting self - regulators and
voiced frustration with the industry ' s oversight of itself .
the new charter put the pob in charge of supervising the
setting of auditing and audit - independence standards and
monitoring how firms audit public companies . it also gave the
board , which is funded by the industry , the power to set its own
budget with no strings attached .
` ` now , for the first time , we will see if the pob is able to
act in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to
it by congressman dingell and by its new charter , ' ' turner said .
` ` they didn ' t have the power in the past . ' '
the pob was set up in 1977 to represent the public interest
in overseeing the accounting industry ' s self - governance structure .
before its charter was revised , the pob was just one facet of the
enforcement of auditing industry standards regarding publicly
traded companies . now , it oversees the activities of these other
groups as well .
newpower plugs cash drain by revamping power pact with enron
2001 - 11 - 20 11 : 05 ( new york )
newpower plugs cash drain by revamping power pact with enron
washington , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings inc . ,
one of the first companies to market power to homeowners
nationwide , recently plugged a cash drain brought on by plunging
energy prices .
the purchase , new york , company buys gas and electricity from
suppliers such as enron corp . and resells the energy to
residential and small business customers in states such as
pennsylvania , ohio , georgia and texas . newpower markets its
service as an alternative to local utilities in restructured
retail energy markets .
recent declines in energy prices have required newpower to
deposit $ 110 million in cash with enron , its largest shareholder
as well as a major creditor , leaving the company with about $ 33
million . according to a regulatory filing , enron recently agreed
to allow newpower to replace some of the cash collateral with
assets such as inventory and customer ious .
` ` we had a certain amount of cash tied up in those collateral
positions , ' ' said william jacobs , chief financial officer at
newpower . ` ` obviously , every dollar you put up there reduces the
amount of money you can spend other places . ' '
newpower represents a new breed of energy middleman that
contracts to provide power to retail customers at certain prices .
rather than owning power plants and gas pipelines , though , the
company simply purchases energy - - at slightly lower prices - - from
suppliers such as enron .
the contracts with enron require newpower to post collateral
with the supplier if the market price of natural gas or
electricity falls below the price set in the contract . and prices
for natural gas , used to fuel most electricity plants , have
plunged .
offsetting contracts
natural gas for december delivery fell 4 . 6 cents to $ 2 . 740
per million british thermal units on the new york mercantile
exchange . that is down from a record $ 10 . 10 per million british
thermal units last december .
newpower isn ' t at risk of losing money because the company
has offsetting contracts to sell the electricity and natural gas
at even higher prices to retail customers . it ' s more of a timing
issue : the company has had to post the collateral before the sales
under these retail contracts take place .
nevertheless , the need to provide collateral has weighed
heavily on newpower ' s balance sheet . cash and cash equivalents
have declined to $ 33 . 4 million on sept . 30 from $ 179 . 9 million on
dec . 31 , 2000 . meanwhile , restricted cash , such as the collateral
provided to enron and others , has ballooned to $ 180 . 2 million from
$ 16 . 2 million during the same period .
other transactions
on oct . 18 , according to a quarterly report filed with the
securities and exchange commission , enron agreed to permit
newpower to substitute inventory and customer receivables for as
much as $ 40 million of the cash collateral . this agreement will
expire jan . 4 , 2002 .
` ` assuming broadly stable forward energy prices , ' ' the filing
said , newpower ` ` has sufficient financial resources to conduct its
business until it secures permanent asset - backed or similar
financing . ' '
the company also said in the sec filing that it has recently
entered into a series of transactions ` ` to reduce the risk of
posting additional cash as collateral ' ' if energy prices fall
further . these transactions , which the company says are an
exception to its usual hedging strategy , ` ` increase the company ' s
exposure to commodity price fluctuations . ' '
joint venture
newpower was formed as a joint venture between enron , general
electric capital corp . , the california public employee ' s
retirement system , the ontario teachers ' pension plan board , and
the merchant banking arm of donaldson , lufkin & jenrette inc . , now
owned by credit suisse group .
in october 2000 , the company held an initial public offering
of 24 million common shares at $ 21 each . newpower shares have
fallen more than 83 percent so far this year and now trade at
$ 1 . 60 each .
enron falls after company cuts earnings , says $ 690 mln note due
2001 - 11 - 20 09 : 39 ( new york )
enron falls after company cuts earnings , says $ 690 mln note due
houston , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares fell as
much as 10 percent after the biggest energy trader restated third -
quarter earnings for a second time this month and said it may have
to make early payment of a $ 690 million note next week .
shares of enron , which agreed to a takeover by rival dynegy
inc . this month after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy , fell 86 cents to $ 8 . 20 . dynegy fell $ 1 . 30 to $ 42 . 30 .
enron reduced third - quarter results by 3 cents a share ,
bringing the period ' s loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million , according
to a u . s . securities & exchange commission filing . on nov . 8 ,
enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $ 586 million to reflect
losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the
books . that included a third - quarter reduction of $ 17 million .
a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by
standard & poor ' s on nov . 12 may force enron to pay off the
$ 690 million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to
guarantee the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership , the
company said in the filing released yesterday after the u . s . stock
market closed .
without repayment or collateral , investors in a partnership
that owns brazilian natural - gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership ' s assets , enron said . the company said it ' s working
with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books . its shares plunged this year as investors
questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide
losses from failed investments .
chief executive officer kenneth lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
enron shareholders $ 1 . 2 billion in lost equity .
making good on debt owed by its whitewing affiliated
partnership may cut enron ' s fourth - quarter earnings , enron said .
enron is obligated to back whitewing by issuing junior convertible
preferred stock . because enron ' s stock has plunged , it may have to
write down its assets by $ 700 million , the filing said .
dynegy agreed nov . 9 to buy enron in a transaction now valued
at $ 25 billion in stock and assumed debt . both companies are based
in houston .
chevrontexaco corp . , the second - largest u . s . oil company ,
owns 26 percent of dynegy and is providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as
part of the enron buyout .
shares of chevrontexaco , based in san francisco , rose $ 1 . 63
to $ 84 . 54 .

usa : reliant surprised by latest enron disclosure .
11 / 20 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 20 ( reuters ) - reliant resources inc . , a trading partner of beleaguered energy trading giant enron corp . , said on tuesday it was surprised by news that enron could be forced to pay $ 690 million in debt next week because of a credit rating downgrade .
shahid malik , reliant ' s president of energy trading and marketing , said his company was still evaluating the implications of the disclosure , which enron made in a filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) on monday .
"" it ' s another surprise to the industry . we don ' t need any more surprises , "" malik told reporters at a press presentation of a new index devised by houston - based reliant to track natural gas consumption .
reliant is a big wholesale electricity and natural gas trader and as such both a competitor and trading counterparty of enron .
malik said enron executives had not mentioned the potential payment of $ 690 million during a conference call with analysts on nov . 14 , two days before the credit rating downgrade that triggered it on nov . 12 .
enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . for some $ 9 billion in stock on nov . 9 after a collapse in investor confidence and snowballing financial problems brought enron to the brink of collapse .
dynegy wrote clauses into its agreement with enron that allow it to walk away from the deal if the problems at enron turn out to be far worse than previously disclosed , but dynegy executives have said it is unlikely those clauses will be invoked .
malik said that as a trading partner in wholesale energy markets , reliant will seek further clarification from enron about its financial position .
"" my guess is that they are going to have a hard time coming up with the money , "" he said .
malik said enron ' s bids and offers in the wholesale electricity and natural gas markets had become less competitive in recent weeks and that this had allowed reliant and other companies to capture some market share from enron .
reliant continued to do business with enron , he said , but was exercising "" heightened caution "" .
malik said reliant had not hired any traders away from enron recently and was currently well staffed . "" but you always look for good people , you always look for talent , "" he added .

stockwatch enron slides after warning on debt , cut in q 3 eps
11 / 20 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - shares of enron corp were sharply lower in midsession trade after the company warned yesterday that it faces heavy debt repayment obligations in less than 10 days , and has reduced its already - reported third - quarter earnings , dealers said .
at 12 . 10 pm , enron was down 1 . 16 usd , or 12 . 80 pct , at 7 . 90 . chevrontexaco inc affiliate dynegy inc , which agreed to acquire enron for 8 . 5 bln usd in cash and paper , was down 20 cents , or 0 . 46 pct , at 43 . 40 . chevrontexaco was up 3 . 15 usd at 86 . 06 .
the djia was down 71 . 69 points at 9 , 904 . 77 and the s & p 500 was down 5 . 42 points at 1145 . 24 .
in a 10 q filing with the securities and exchange commission , enron said that because of a credit rating downgrade last week , it now faces a debt payment of 690 mln usd by nov 27 .
it also restated its third - quarter earnings , lowering them by 3 cents per share .
wall street analysts , however , said the announcement was not surprising following the company ' s recent credit downgrades and enron ' s board investigation into the company ' s balance sheet .
they also said the news should not endanger enron ' s purchase by chevrontexaco affiliate dynegy .
credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who maintained his strong buy rating on enron , said he expects the company ' s 690 mln usd obligation will be renegotiated , and "" satisfied out of ( enron ' s ) current cash position of 1 . 5 bln usd or collateralized . ""
the analyst said he already had factored in a reduction in enron ' s fourth - quarter eps , to 40 cents from 48 previously , because of those expected issues . however , he now expects fourth - quarter eps of 25 - 35 cents .
as for the dynegy deal , launer sees a 90 pct probability that it will be completed , as dynegy "" demonstrably benefits from it and chevron texaco supports it . ""
yesterday , chevrontexaco chairman david o ' reilly reaffirmed support for the company ' s decision to invest 2 . 5 bln usd in dynegy .
the enron / dynegy deal does contain a "" material adverse change ( mac ) "" clause that could break the deal , but only if enron liabilities exceed 2 bln usd net of insurance or reserves .
in its 10 q filing , enron also detailed its plans to dispose of 8 bln usd of non - core assets , mainly international and broadband assets .
csfb ' s launer said his strong buy rating on enron , reflects his expectations that the deal spread , currently at about 30 pct , will narrow as progress is made toward a closing .
csfb disclosed that launer ' s immediate family owns shares of enron , estimated at less than 250 .

andersen - enron audit prompts look at peer reviews ( updatel )

andersen - enron audit prompts look at peer reviews ( updatel )
( adds information on accounting firms in seventh paragraph . )
washington , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - an accounting industry
oversight group , prompted by concerns about arthur andersen llp ' s
failed audits of enron corp . , plans to look at the adequacy of
letting u . s . audit firms police one another , said the group ' s
chairman , charles bowsher .
the question for the public oversight board involves the
industry ' s system of ` ` peer reviews , ' ' in which auditors submit
their reports on public companies for examination by other
accounting firms , in an effort to assure investors the audits
comply with accounting standards .
` ` how can you have peer reviews and still have these kinds of
failures ? ' ' bowsher , a former u . s . comptroller general , asked in
an interview . the board ' s examination will consider the broad
issue of industry oversight , leaving specific review of enron ' s
audits to the securities and exchange commission , he said .
houston - based enron , the largest energy trader , this month
said it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over four - and - a - half
years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion because of an
accounting error , and failed to consolidate results of three
affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
the oversight board , created to supervise the accounting
industry ' s self - governance practices , will address the issue dec .
4 , bowsher said .
andersen , the world ' s fifth - largest accounting firm , was
enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring investors
that the company ' s financial statements conformed with generally
accepted accounting principles . deloitte & touche llp has been the
firm assigned to do andersen ' s peer reviews .
dingell skeptical
u . s . representative john dingell , a michigan democrat ,
questioned the peer review process yesterday in a letter to
bowsher . none of the five biggest international accounting firms
has ever issued a negative peer - review report against another ,
dingell said . the so - called big five are andersen , deloitte &
touche , llc , kpmg llp , and ernst & young
lp .
` ` there appears to be little reason for the public to have
faith in andersen or the peer review process , ' ' dingell wrote .
andersen responded that it has faith in the accounting
profession ' s self - regulatory process , which the pob oversees .
a spokeswoman at deloitte & touche didn ' t return a telephone
call seeking comment .
the oversight board was thinking of looking into peer review
issues before receiving dingell ' s letter , bowsher said . ` ` but this
letter certainly focuses the issue , ' ' he said .
conflict of interest ?
dingell ' s letter said the outside counsel to a special
committee of enron ' s board has retained deloitte & touche - -
andersen ' s peer reviewer - - to help it examine the company ' s
accounting problems .
` ` do ( deloitte & touche ' s ) dual roles create a conflict of
interest ? ' ' dingell ' s letter asked . ` ` if ( deloitte & touche ) finds
numerous problems on enron , will ( deloitte & touche ) try to
` whitewash ' or reconcile them in order to be able to issue a clean
peer review report ? ' '
dingell also questioned whether the money andersen pays
deloitte & touche for its peer review will sway the outcome .
` ` how will this influence , if at all , ( deloitte & touche ' s )
` independent ' judgment of andersen ' s work on enron ? ' ' dingell
asked .
bowsher there is ` ` nothing we can do to change the fact that
deloitte & touche has done the previous reviews of andersen . now ,
the question is should they ( the outside counsel ) use the same
firm , or would it be better for them to use another firm ? and
that ' s pretty much their decision . ' '
expanded power
dingell ' s request could prove a test of the oversight board ' s
expanded power and oversight . the group ' s charter was revised
earlier this year to make the board the accounting industry ' s
premier watchdog group , following criticisms by former sec
chairman arthur levitt and former sec chief accountant lynn
turner . they criticized an ` ` alphabet soup ' ' of accounting self -
regulators and voiced frustration with the industry ' s oversight of
itself .
the new charter put the oversight board in charge of
supervising the setting of auditing and audit - independence
standards and monitoring how firms audit public companies . it also
gave the board , which is funded by the industry , the power to set
its own budget with no strings attached .
` ` now , for the first time , we will see if the pob is able to
act in the public interest and undertake the mandate presented to
it by congressman dingell and by its new charter , ' ' turner said .
` ` they didn ' t have the power in the past . ' '
the public oversight board was set up in 1977 to represent
the public interest in overseeing the accounting industry ' s self -
governance structure . before its charter was revised , the board
was just one facet of the enforcement of auditing industry
standards regarding publicly traded companies . now , it oversees
the activities of these other groups as well .
energy cos limit business with enron after 10 q - traders

new york - ( dow jones ) - many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell power and natural gas for next day delivery to enron corp . ( ene ) tuesday morning , a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of enron ' s quarterly financial report monday , traders and other sources said .
for weeks , companies have limited both buying and selling with enron for future deliveries . but for the first time since enron ' s troubles began a month ago , energy companies weren ' t selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month .
"" it ' s pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now , "" said charlie sanchez , energy market manager for gelber & associates in houston .
traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn ' t sell to enron tuesday morning . several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation , but declined to say so on the record .
"" nobody will take enron , "" one western electricity broker said . after struggling , however , that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to enron tuesday morning .
calpine , a prominent independent power producer and trader , said it was willing to sell power to enron .
"" we continue to sell power to enron and are monitoring the situation closely , "" spokeswoman catherine potter said .
the situation tuesday morning was fluid . one utility that refused to sell to enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon , a person at the company said . that company ' s trading , however , was still limited to the spot markets .
credit concerns about the once - dominant energy trading company were heightened with enron ' s filing of its third quarter annual report monday evening with the u . s . securities exchange commission .
enron may have to pay $ 690 million on a note that became a demand obligation with the company ' s most recent credit - rating downgrade , enron said in monday ' s filing . the company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns , a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity .
"" the 10 q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns , "" fitch analyst ralph pellecchia said . "" we have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they are going to manage the situation . ""
companies are willing to buy from enron in the spot gas and power markets , because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer
an enron spokesman didn ' t respond to a request for comment .
reliant resources ( rri ) and the bonneville power administration , the federal government ' s western power marketer , both said their organizations are continuing to "" do business "" with enron . but when asked specifically if they were selling spot power or gas to enron , spokesmen for both declined to comment .
"" we ' re watching the situation very carefully , "" said reliant spokesman richard wheatley . "" there is a lot of speculation because of the filing yesterday . ""
energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month , as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75 % drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk - rated debt .
traders and their companies have said consistently that until enron ' s credit ratings improve , they will continue to watch their exposure to enron carefully , with trades limited to short - term deals .
moody ' s investors service , standard & poor ' s and fitch all rate enron one notch above speculative grade . moody ' s has enron ' s ratings on review for a downgrade , and s & p has enron on negative credit watch . fitch calls enron ' s credit rating "" evolving . "" enron ' s ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment - grade ratings .
the manager of one hedge fund that follows enron closely said tuesday that several trading companies expressed strong concerns about enron ' s financial viability . but the manager thought those concerns weren ' t proportionate to enron ' s position .
"" they have nine days to work out the $ 690 million debt payment , and if they can ' t work it out , they have the cash to make the payment , "" the manager said .
dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , which has agreed to buy enron in a stock - swap currently worth about $ 10 billion , injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron last week . enron has also closed on $ 1 billion worth of revolving credit lines with j . p . morgan chase & co . ( jpm ) and citigroup ( c ) in the past week , with $ 450 million of that amount closed monday .
developments with enron , however , have raised enough concerns that energy companies aren ' t willing to extend themselves into positions that have even the appearance of vulnerability , sanchez of gelber & associates said .
"" the industry has been shell - shocked by their recent announcements , and they ' re not ready to go back to trading with them , "" said sanchez of gelber 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com
( john edmiston in houston , kristen mcnamara in new york and jon kamp in chicago contributed to this article . )
reached later , dynegy made clear it wouldn ' t take any extraordinary measures to support enron in the market .
"" we will operate as two separate companies until the merger is completed , "" dynegy spokesman john sousa said . "" we have to act independently . ""
mirant corp . ( mir ) , a major trader of north american power and case , has trimmed its business with enron .
"" we ' re trading on a very limited basis , "" said spokesman chuck griffin , who wouldn ' t be more specific .
cinergy corp . ( cin ) , a mid - sized energy trading company , said it is buying and selling gas and power with enron .

us ferc denies regulatory waiver for dynegy lng terminal
11 / 20 / 2001
dow jones energy service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
washington - ( dow jones ) - the federal energy regulatory commission denied tuesday dynegy inc . ' s ( dyn ) request for regulatory exemption of its planned liquefied natural gas , or lng , import terminal on the u . s . gulf coast .
in what would be the first new lng import site in nearly two decades , dynegy has proposed converting an existing terminal in hackberry , la . , to receive lng imports at a rate of up to 750 million cubic feet a day with capacity to later expand up to 1 . 5 billion cubic feet a day .
in its august application to ferc , dynegy said lng import terminals should no longer face regulatory burdens designed in the 1970 s .
tuesday , ferc said "" there is no indication that congress intended to remove commission jurisdiction over the siting , construction , and operation of lng import facilities . "" the commission added that "" there would be a regulatory gap without commission jurisdiction . ""
ferc chairman pat wood said it was a close decision to deny the company ' s request , although commissioners voted unanimously to do so .
commissioner william massey said granting a regulatory waiver would have made it impossible to ensure open access to the lng facility , which he described as "" a gatekeeper to the u . s . market . ""
three of the four existing u . s . lng import terminals are under strict ferc price regulations . dynegy said these regulations and the guaranteed cost recovery they entail led to unnecessary lng investment in the early 1980 s . the company argued that lng imports should be treated as "" first sale "" gas over which the commission has no jurisdiction .
dynegy announced the project in july and planned to begin receiving lng shipments by the end of 2003 .
the project involves converting an existing liquefied petroleum gas terminal and dock to receive lng . dynegy plans to convert an lpg tanker under construction to carry lng instead by the targeted fourth - quarter 2003 start of operations , and it would seek additional lng tankers in 2004 .
companies use lng tankers and terminals to import gas from remote overseas gas fields in countries such as algeria , trinidad 202 - 862 - 9291 ; campion . walsh @ dowjones . com

usa : update 2 - enron stock hits decade low after debt warning .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
( previous dateline new york , updates paragraphs 1 - 6 share price , s & p announcement )
houston , nov 20 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade on investor concerns more debt problems loom at the crippled energy trading giant .
in late afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , shares of enron were off $ 2 . 16 , or 23 . 8 percent , at $ 6 . 90 , after touching an intraday low of $ 6 . 55 - a low not seen since may 1991 .
enron was far and away the day ' s most - active stock , with more than 55 . 5 million shares changing hands . volume was more than double the second most - active issue , xerox corp .
"" everyone wants to sink the ship faster . this is a sell - off from yesterday ' s news which was hyped by the media , "" said fulcrum global partners analyst michael barbis .
enron warned in a u . s . securities and exchange filing released after markets closed on monday that it could be forced by next week to pay $ 690 million in debt because of a credit downgrade on nov . 12 .
the filing made the stark statement that enron would fail to be a "" going concern "" if a further credit cut forces it pay off $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to partnerships it is involved in . an early payoff of those debts would render enron unable to service its revolving credit accounts , starting a downward spiral , it said .
meanwhile , credit rating agency standard & poor ' s said that it may again cut enron ' s bbb - minus rating , which could trigger those debt payoffs . but the agency said enron ' s liquidity issues were unlikely to derail its merger with smaller cross - town rival dynegy inc .
next week ' s deadline
analysts said there were no surprising revelations in enron ' s filing yesterday and that it should have no effect on plans by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to buy enron .
"" the facts have not changed so dramatically for the stock to be down this magnitude , "" barbis said .
on monday , enron disclosed it is up against a nov . 26 deadline , when it must deliver collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships .
if not , the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership , which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash .
enron is working to make alternative payment arrangements , since it can ill - afford to pay the debt now . enron has already already maxed out its $ 3 billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat .
"" enron has access to more than $ 3 billion in cash . they can pay off this note . they have cash coming in and are not illiquid , "" said barbis . "" the timing of the note could have been better , but enron keeps cash on hand for situations like this . this will not undermine the dynegy deal . ""
on monday , the houston - based company also reduced previously reported 2001 third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share .

cnnfn : market coverage - morning
( c ) copyright federal document clearing house . all rights reserved .
rhonda schaffler , cnnfn anchor , market call : chuck kadlec is our guest host tracking the sell off . you know , the enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) story you know has been in the headlines now for weeks . but it ` s one of these cases where if you invest in a stock and you sort of buy into the story , it ` s very difficult for some investors who now lost a lot of money . and everyday it seems there ` s a new revelation there . how do you counsel people to sort of , you know , catch things that even some of the street don ` t catch ?
charles kadlec , j & w seligman : well , it ` s obvious you can ` t catch them because , if we could have , we would have . the best analysts on the street missed this one . i think the real message here is the importance of diversification . and i think it also raises some important questions about corporate governance at enron . and there , clearly , was something missing not only among the senior executive officers of that corporation but the board of directors as well .
schaffler : in general , we ` re seeing the markets just sort of retreat here . but it seems to be one of these sort of calm pullbacks we ` ve talked so much throughout the show . the dow started the day up better than 20 percent .
the nasdaq up about 30 percent from the lows .
and the one situation we ` ve had when the markets pulled back , through those couple of weeks , is the buyers always come back in . we know that fund inflows were up in october . we also know october sometimes is when we see bottoms in markets . just historically it seems that it happens in october . the data on the fund flows , does that intrigue you at all ?
kadlec : well , i think it ` s just another of those straws in the wind , if you will . the leading economic indicators being up 0 . 3 percent today . i wouldn ` t bet the ranch on that single number , but it ` s positive , better than expected . positive inflows suggest that fear , which was not only impacting the market , was clearly impacting the economy , starting to recede that ` s a positive .
and i think individual investors are beginning to look beyond the immediate news into next year . and , you know , we ` ve had nine recessions . up until now , we ` ve had nine recoveries . we ` re probably in the middle of the 10 th recession . and we ` re going to have a recovery . so , as people begin to try to size up the shape and the duration of that recovery , they ` re beginning to , again , deploy their assets back into equities , which provide the best long - term returns of any asset class .
schaffler : it ` s interesting too because , you know , we ` ve talked through the last couple of months it was always the cash on the sidelines . you know , we kept quoting how much was in money market funds just waiting to be deployed . do you have any sense of how much momentum there is still to come into this market ? how much money there might still be out there ? do you get the idea that the institutions as well as some retail customers might still be holding on to some money to re - deploy assets at this point ?
kadlec : my sense is that - like at seligman , for example , our teams are really focused on positioning the portfolios and to take advantage of the upturn that ` s coming . so you ` re seeing a move more toward cyclicals . selecting really good companies that perhaps are oversold .
we ` re also seeing horizons lengthen out a little bit . people beginning to think of what all of next year is going to look like . really , very little attention to what ` s happening in the fourth quarter of this year . we already know the economy ` s in trouble . if anything , we ` re set up for a positive surprise i think over the holiday season in terms of the consumer here .
schaffler : let ` s find out exactly what ` s going on now at the big board .
we know that stocks are moving lower .

deregulation not seen leaderless after enron ' s collapse
by bryan lee
of dow jones newswires
11 / 20 / 2001
dow jones energy service

washington - ( dow jones ) - the movement to deregulate the country ' s electricity markets is about to find out whether it needs the 800 - pound gorilla that has long sat in its corner .
for years , enron corp . ( ene ) has been the country ' s most aggressive advocate of opening energy markets to competition , and enron is now on the ropes , slated if all goes as planned to be absorbed by smaller rival dynegy inc . ( dyn ) .
but industry observers said its demise won ' t open a leadership void in the regulatory battle . while enron ' s efforts were critical in the early efforts to pry open markets , that work has largely been done , and there are now plenty of like - minded companies able step in , observers said .
"" it is true that enron has been a leader in pushing policies for a competitive market , "" said linda stuntz , a former top energy department official now with stuntz , davis & staffier . "" but the news is they ' re not alone any more . there are a lot of others who will carry the flag . ""
enron , an object lesson in how the mighty have fallen , has been the industry ' s undisputed leader in pushing for competitive power markets at both the federal and state levels . the company is a dominant player in any policy debate before the federal energy regulatory commission , and its positions weigh heavily as congress debates electric industry reform legislation .
lobbyists describe enron ' s washington office as "" huge , "" far surpassing that of dynegy .
enron also had tremendous political clout . the company successfully backed top texas regulator pat wood iii for the ferc chairmanship earlier this year . enron chairman ken lay has been a key political backer of president george w . bush , raising at least $ 100 , 000 for his campaign . the company itself contributed $ 114 , 000 .
enron spent $ 2 . 4 million in the last federal election cycle , making it one of the nation ' s biggest political contributors , according to the center for responsive politics , an advocacy group that monitors political campaign spending and influence .
"" the company ' s contribution total for the 2000 elections more than doubled its political donations in each of the two previous election cycles , "" the center reports .
broad support seen for markets
no company has come close to making enron ' s commitment to shaping the laws and regulations that govern the energy industry . still , industry observers see support for competitive energy markets even without enron ' s largess .
"" i think that there is a tremendous political will from all the leaders on all sides of congress and the administration to move forward on electricity competition legislation , "" said edison electric institute president thomas kuhn . "" i don ' t the think the enron situation is going to make any difference at all .
officials with the two companies adamantly reject the premise that their merger will create a vacuum in the push for greater competition in the $ 220 billion electricity sector .
"" dynegy ' s going to continue to advocate open and competitive markets , "" spokesman steve stengel said . "" i can ' t speculate on what the new company is going to spend on lobbying efforts or what the combined entities ' staff will look like . but clearly enron and dynegy share a belief in open and competitive markets , and the new entity will certainly continue to be vocal about opening markets to competition . ""
rick shapiro , enron ' s managing director of global government affairs , echoed that view . he also said it was unlikely opponents of deregulation would succeed in using enron ' s troubles as a reason not to further open markets .
"" there will be companies that will try to use enron ' s business problems as a reason to not move forward . but regulators will separate what happened to enron from the rightness of the idea , "" shapiro said . "" the validity of competition has been proven over and over again . this is not going to have a long - term effect . ""
dynegy will probably inherit some of enron ' s aggressiveness in lobbying , stuntz said .
state - level view mixed
energy lawyers suggested that , in many respects , the public policy debate over competition has already been won . for instance , one - third of the power - generation capacity in the u . s . is now owned by companies other than the utilities that once enjoyed monopolies , stuntz said .
"" i ' m not sure at the end of the day this really changes all that much , "" said william scherman , a former ferc general counsel now with skadden , arps , slate , meagher 202 - 862 - 6647 ; bryan . lee @ dowjones . com

enron falls amid concern debt threatens dynegy bid ( update 6 )
2001 - 11 - 20 16 : 47 ( new york )
enron falls amid concern debt threatens dynegy bid ( update 6 )
( adds dynegy ' s watson declined to comment on enron filings in
final paragraph . )
houston , nov . 20 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares and bonds
dropped after the energy trader disclosed it may have to pay $ 9 . 15
billion in debt due by 2003 , suggesting the company may run out of
cash before its takeover by dynegy inc . can be completed .
shares of enron fell $ 2 . 05 , or 23 percent , to $ 7 . 01 . earlier
they touched $ 6 . 55 , the lowest price in more than a decade .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in july 2006 were bid as low as 69
cents on $ 1 of face value and offered at 73 cents , down more than
13 percent , traders said .
enron , whose dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements , credit - rating cuts , a federal investigation
and a management shakeup , said in a regulatory filing that it has
less than $ 2 billion in cash or credit lines . dynegy plans to
complete its buyout by october , and enron may have to ask lenders
to restructure payment schedules to survive .
` ` this filing shows that enron is in a precarious financial
situation , ' ' said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade , who
rates enron shares ` ` hold ' ' and doesn ' t own them . ` ` they have to
stay afloat for the dynegy deal to go through , and that now looks
difficult . ' '
enron and dynegy spokespeople wouldn ' t comment on the stock
drop today . standard & poor ' s investors service said that enron ' s
credit rating remained on negative watch , indicating it wouldn ' t
immediately downgrade the company ' s debt .
$ 690 million surprise
` ` enron ' s near - term liquidity position is . . . expected to be
sufficient to carry the company through the completion of its
proposed merger with dynegy , ' ' s & p said in a report .
investors were concerned the debt , including a $ 690 million
note that enron disclosed it may have to pay off next week , would
lead to a cut in enron ' s credit rating , analysts said .
the filing was a ` ` distraction ' ' that will not threaten the
merger , said todd shipman , a director at s & p who follows enron .
` ` our approach to this has been on the basis that the dynegy
deal is a good thing for credit quality , ' ' shipman said .
moody ' s investors service , which didn ' t issue a statement on
enron ' s debt today , kept the company ' s credit rating at investment
grade on nov . 9 , the day dynegy announced it would buy enron in a
deal now valued at $ 25 billion in stock and assumed debt .
the ruling came after executives from lehman brothers
holding inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . ' s salomon
smith barney lobbied the credit - rating company , people familiar
with the situation said .
avoiding junk
a junk rating would have led dynegy to abandon the
acquisition , dynegy chief executive officer charles watson said .
it would also have triggered debt repayment of at least $ 3 . 9
billion , enron said in a securities & exchange commission filing
yesterday .
enron shares are selling for almost 32 percent less than the
value of dynegy ' s offer , showing investors have doubts the deal
will be completed . dynegy shares fell $ 1 . 90 to $ 41 . 70 today .
` ` it ' s become more clear that the chances of this deal going
through aren ' t 90 percent , but much closer to fifty - fifty , ' ' said
edward paik , who helps manage the liberty utilities fund , with 1 . 6
million enron shares . ` ` there ' s just so much information that is
unknowable ' ' about enron ' s financial position , he said .
most of the $ 9 . 15 billion in debt is due before the end of
the third quarter of 2002 , when the dynegy buyout is scheduled to
close , enron said yesterday in a filing with the sec .
asset sales planned
last week , enron chief operating officer greg whalley said
the company will sell assets of ` ` non - core businesses ' ' to raise
money . it has $ 8 billion invested in the businesses , including
broadband telecommunications and the dabhol power plant in india .
enron expects to get ` ` billions ' ' from the sales , whalley said ,
without being more specific .
enron reported yesterday that its u . s . operations had $ 1 . 2
billion in cash left . it has added at least $ 5 billion since sept .
30 from credit lines , loans and a $ 1 . 5 billion investment from
chevrontexaco , part owner of dynegy .
enron used $ 1 . 9 billion of the money it raised to retire
commercial paper , which is short - term debt . it gave no details on
how it spent the remaining $ 3 . 1 billion .
enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said last week
that the company also was looking to get another $ 500 million to
$ 1 billion from private investors .
asset sales valued at about $ 800 million are expected to
close by the end of this year , according to the sec filing . enron
spokeswoman karen denne wouldn ' t comment on whether it could sell
assets fast enough to keep current on its debts .
dynegy will have to help enron sell assets , said mitchell
stapley , who manages $ 3 . 5 billion in fixed - income assets including
enron bonds for fifth third investment advisors inc .
dynegy and chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of
dynegy , also will have to help enron negotiate with its lenders ,
said kathleen vuchetich , who helps manage the $ 1 . 4 billion strong
american utilities fund , which is 5 percent dynegy shares .
debt questioned
` ` i never dreamt ( the $ 9 . 15 billion ) would be that large ,
coming due all at once , ' ' vuchetich said . ` ` it calls into question
their decision to schedule it that way in the first place . ' '
chevrontexaco , the second - largest u . s . oil company , is
providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout . it
provided the first $ 1 . 5 billion a week ago . in exchange for that
investment , dynegy will get a pipeline valued at more than $ 2
billion if the enron purchase is not completed .
shares of chevrontexaco , based in san francisco , rose $ 3 . 62
to $ 86 . 53 .
enron yesterday reduced third - quarter results by 3 cents a
share , bringing the period ' s loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million . on
nov . 8 , enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $ 586 million to
reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept
off the books . that included a third - quarter reduction of $ 17
million .
a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by
standard & poor ' s on nov . 12 may force enron to pay off a $ 690
million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership that owns brazilian
natural - gas assets , the filing said .
without repayment or collateral , investors can begin to
liquidate the partnership ' s assets , enron said . the company said
it ' s working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement
on the debt .
making good on debt owed by its whitewing affiliated
partnership may cut enron ' s fourth - quarter earnings , enron said .
enron is obligated to back whitewing by issuing junior convertible
preferred stock . because enron ' s stock has plunged , it may have to
write down its assets by $ 700 million , the filing said .
dynegy ' s watson said when the enron buyout was announced that
he was convinced enron ' s trading operations are sound , and he
called disclosure about financial partnerships such as whitewing
as ` ` financial noise . ' ' he declined a request to comment today on
enron ' s latest filings , dynegy spokeswoman jennifer rosser said .

new york ( afx ) - standard & poor ' s said its ' bbb - minus ' and "" a - 3 "" ratings for enron corp will remain on creditwatch with negative implications , which is one notch above junk status after the ailing energy group warned it may have to pay off a 690 mln usd note next week .
in a statement , the rating agency also said enron ' s near - term liquidity position is "" expected to be sufficient "" to enable it to merge with dynegy inc , in a deal scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2002 .
yesterday , enron warned that it faces heavy debt repayment obligations in less than 10 days , and has reduced its already - reported third - quarter earnings .
in a 10 q filing with the securities and exchange commission , enron said that because of a credit rating downgrade last week , it now faces a debt payment of 690 mln usd by nov 27 .
enron also said it may have to pay 9 . 15 bln in debt due by 2003 , suggesting the company may run out of cash before its takeover by dynegy can be completed .
the group also restated its third - quarter earnings , lowering them by 3 cents per share .

an old man , a boy and a donkey were going to town . the

the man and boy thought maybe the critics were right ,

max ,
i would find it doubtful that that the flight crew would test the aircraft in such a fashion , during a scheduled flight with pax aboard . anytime there is a problem with flight control that is very serious . i ' m glad they seemed to have handled the situation . it probably was not a vor problem but more likely a flight control problem i . e . control surfaces , rudder , ailerons . the vor fail message could have been due to a power down of the avionics consistent with a post emergency - landing procedure .
i have a commercial pilot certificate and have done some charter work . in addition i ' ve flown a 757 in the simulator at united and know how many back ups those things have . they are very redundant .
i ' m really glad everything turned out okay .
all the best ,

andy :
i was actually the person to whom this happened . i was on an aeromexico flight yesterday from mexico city to monterrey . within minutes after leaving mexico city the plane started to hump up and down and then started fishtailing . it is unclear whether this was something the pilot was doing to test the plane or not . we quickly circled back to mexico city , but came in very , very low on our approach ( and seemed to be losing speed ) .
in any event , as i was exiting the plane , i looked into the cockpit and saw the message "" vor 2 fail "" on the center display . being an admitted greenhorn at these things , i didn ' t know what else to look for or where to look for it , so there may have been something i overlooked .
the crew was very short on details , but they appeared very rattled by all of this . one of the flight attendants told a fellow passenger who was complaining about being late that he should simply be thankful he was still alive . [ probably not what they teach in flight attendant school as the optimal response , but . . . . . . ]
in any event , i appreciate the info below and would appreciate any additional info this message may lead you to . i ' d love to know whether or not the adrenaline surge was warranted .

a vor is the standard instrument for navigating an aircraft under an ifr flight plan . it is the receiver that allows the plane to be flown on bearings from ground stations . if it were to fail there would be loads of backups , although if you are on a scheduled flight their operations manual would dictate that the flight be terminated as soon as practicable in the event any primary component , such as this were to fail . where were you that you were able to monitor the performance of this instrument ? the flight deck ?

during our month - end processes i have researched deal # 549162 . 1 . the counterparty did change as bill pointed out , but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for he 3 . originally the deal liquidated with he 3 ( 40 mwh * $ 135 ) , he 4 ( 15 mwh * $ 135 ) , and he 5 ( 20 mwh * $ 135 ) , but on 4 / 19 / 2001 the volume for he 3 was zeroed out in scheduling , which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in he 3 back .

i have one question on this month ' s pma and some questions from last month . first , for deal # 549162 , this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty tacomasupp . this counterparty was then changed to tacomapubuit . why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue ? are we being charged for each counterparty again ( like ees and st - cali last month ) , if so , we need to fix this flawed tool .
second , for last month , we determined that the wbom book needs a $ 108 , 000 pma for change in price . the appropriate price is in enpower , but the revenue has never appeared ( deal # 590753 ) . remember , this deal was originally input as a buy at $ 320 and a sell at $ 30 and liquidated at these prices . the deal is now at $ 320 and $ 300 . what do we need to do to get this trued up ?
please come see me with questions .

( wraps financial - creditquality - moodys and financial - defaults - s & p )
by jonathan stempel
new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better , and about $ 100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the united states heads into recession , according to reports issued on monday by two top credit rating agencies .
moody ' s investors service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 u . s . companies with $ 543 billion of debt in the third quarter , dwarfing the 22 companies with $ 66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade . reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit .
"" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist .
meanwhile , standard & poor ' s said more than 200 companies will default on about $ 100 billion of debt this year , compared with 117 defaulting on a record $ 42 . 3 billion in 2000 .
it said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated "" bb - plus "" or lower by s & p and "" bal "" or lower by moody ' s because of their credit risks - will reach 9 . 4 percent by year end . moody ' s forecasts a 10 percent rate .
"" the u . s . economy is clearly in a recession , "" said s & p chief economist david wyss in a statement . "" although standard & poor ' s expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002 , the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high . ""
both agencies said the sept . 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three - year slump in corporate credit quality . moody ' s blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in september alone on the attacks .
costs rise , protection weakens
u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons .
these include the weakening economy , the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates , share buybacks , debt - financed merger activity , and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance and travel .
"" many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink , "" said david keisman , managing director at s & p risk solutions .
even well - known companies are suffering rating declines .
on monday alone , for example , s & p downgraded mcdonald corp . after the world ' s largest fast - food chain said it will buy back up to $ 5 billion of stock , at a time s & p said the company ' s "" growth prospects for the future are less optimistic . ""
meanwhile , moody ' s downgraded enron corp . , and warned it may downgrade it again . the energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence , reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks , as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business .
puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively .
"" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said .
still , through friday , moody ' s has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies , and upgrade just four .

usa : u . s . firms say deals with enron at normal levels .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , oct 29 ( reuters ) - major u . s . wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on monday their deals with troubled enron corp . are still running at normal levels .
but some are keeping a wary eye on the company ' s finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies .
"" we certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis , "" chief executive marce fuller of atlanta energy marketer mirant corp . told reuters .
"" at this point , i would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with enron , but we ' ll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward , "" said fuller .
officials at companies such as houston natural gas firm el paso corp . and columbus , ohio , utility holding company american electric power co . inc . expressed similar sentiments , saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the houston - based energy company , at least for the time being .
"" we continue to trade with them , "" said spokeswoman jennifer pierce of charlotte - based utility duke energy corp . . "" they ' ve always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them , "" she added .
enron ' s shares fell to yet another new low on monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency moody ' s investor service downgraded the company ' s senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk - bond status .
since oct . 12 enron ' s stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years , wrote down shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors ' jitters about a series of complex off - balance - sheet financial deals .
confidence crumbles
analysts say that if confidence in enron continued to crumble , it could restrict the company ' s access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations .
european energy industry sources told reuters earlier on monday that there was already evidence of european companies shying away from trading with enron because of credit worries .
several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with enron in europe as they hold urgent talks with the u . s . group about setting up new credit arrangements , the sources said .
"" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" said the head of risk management at one u . k . utility that halted its trade with enron last week . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . ""
traders in the u . s . wholesale energy markets said on monday that they were continuing to deal with enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner .
"" i don ' t have any problems dealing with enron , especially since i ' m doing day - ahead trades . but i have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them , "" one natural gas trader in the u . s . southeast told reuters .
a trader who specializes in longer - term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about enron ' s woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity .
"" obviously there ' s a concern , but the financial situation is not a factor now , "" the trader said .
despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking , enron ' s major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely .
"" any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating , then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried , "" said mirant ' s fuller .

enron bonds stabilize but market players are concerned
by michael c . barr
of dow jones newswires
10 / 29 / 2001
capital markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - uncertainty about enron corp . ( ene ) continues to dog investors concerned about the future of the houston - based energy services company .
"" it ' s such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company ' s circumstances , "" said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . until this occurs , the outlook for the company ' s bonds is choppy , he added .
enron drew down about $ 3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets , buying back its outstanding commercial paper . and , it ' s currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in new credit , according to a report in monday ' s wall street journal .
enron ' s troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and the disclosure of a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
"" the company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure , "" said mitch stapley , portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer , fifth third investment advisors , grand rapids , mich . it becomes harder to regain investors ' trust , he said .
moody ' s investors service lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt rating monday to baa 2 from baal . the debt is rated triple - b - plus by standard & poor ' s corp . , with a negative outlook . fitch also maintains a triple - b - plus rating and it placed the debt on rating watch negative late last week .
both fitch and moody ' s cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments . and moody ' s added that its "" analysis of the developing situation will focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties . ""
one money manager said he was concerned "" about the fallout and its impact on the company ' s ability to trade "" energy .
the company ' s bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty . the bonds with a 6 . 40 % coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar price of 80 on friday . many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is a demarcation separating high - yield debt from distressed debt levels .
the company ' s bonds improved a little on monday , to about an 83 dollar price .

enron ' s stock continues slide on credit woes
10 / 29 / 2001

copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
houston ( ap ) - enron corp . ' s stock slid to new lows on monday , pushed down in part by moody ' s investors service announcing a possible downgrade of the company ' s credit rating pending a review .
the downgrade came as enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the largest u . s . natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company ' s former chief financial officer .
in trading monday afternoon on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down nearly 9 percent , or dlrs 1 . 38 a share , at dlrs 14 . 02 - their lowest level in nearly seven years . a year ago , enron stock sold at nearly dlrs 85 a share .
enron ' s efforts to acquire more credit came after the houston - based company last week decided to cash in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence .
"" we are in discussions about new credit lines , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said monday . "" we ' re taking action to restore investor and market confidence . ""
denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking . but the wall street journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is between dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed .
denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit enron cashed in last week , dlrs 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt . currently , there are no plans for the other dlrs 1 billion , she said .
moody ' s on monday placed all of enron ' s long term debt obligations on review for downgrade , citing "" substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses . ""
on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of dlrs 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings .
enron ' s stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .
enron ousted fastow last week .
moody ' s said in a press release the "" magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 percent while slashing earnings . ""

uk : uk power mkt focuses on prompt after low peak deal .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , oct 29 ( reuters ) - interest in britain ' s electricity markets focused on the prompt after the sale of peak power at an unexpected low price tugged other prompt contracts lower .
traders said the market was surprised by the sale of day ahead peak power for efa blocks three and four , from 0700 to 1500 , at 13 . 50 pounds per megawatt hour which they said was below coal - or gas - fired power stations ' operating cost .
"" it was an interesting day . it was hard to believe someone could sell at those prices - it ' s below marginal costs , "" said one trader .

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - energy trading giant enron corp . , its shares in a new free - fall to near seven - year lows , said on monday it is seeking additional credit to bolster investor confidence after tapping about $ 3 billion in credit last week .
enron , the nation ' s biggest energy trader , declined to comment on the size of the credit line , which banks it is in talks with or when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line .
"" we want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash , "" said enron spokesman mark palmer in houston , referring to company efforts to secure new credit .
company shares again tumbled on monday , shedding $ 1 . 57 , or 10 . 13 percent , to $ 13 . 93 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . once a wall street darling , the stock has tumbled more than half in price since enron released earnings two weeks ago , losing about $ 15 . 1 billion in market capitalization as investors fretted about the transparency of off - balance sheet transactions .
moody ' s investors service on monday cut enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status , and warned it may cut it again , as well as its rating for enron ' s commercial paper . rating agency standard & poor ' s on thursday revised its outlook for enron ' s ratings to "" negative "" from "" stable . ""
enron ' s credit - worthiness has a direct affect on the price it pays to take out loans , and the perception among its trading partners on the company ' s ability to make good on trades .
moody ' s said enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write - downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments . it said this triggered "" difficulties in rolling over commercial paper . ""
industry sources on monday said several large energy companies in europe are shying away from trading with enron amid concerns about the company ' s credit status .
sign of weakness
enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first - quarterly loss in more than four years on oct . 16 . the company also wrote down $ 1 . 2 billion in equity , including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from enron last week .
the sell - off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions , which the securities and exchange commission is examining . enron last week replaced cfo andrew fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence .
the wall street journal reported monday the size of the credit line enron is negotiating is between $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion . enron said it drew down about $ 3 billion in credit lines last week , and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $ 1 billion .
however , many industry observes see the request by enron , which has about $ 63 . 4 billion in energy assets , for an additional credit as a sign of weakness .
"" clearly , both the stock and bond market view enron as being in dire straits , "" said independent research firm gimme credit analyst carol levenson , who specializes in high grade corporate bonds .
"" we are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one ' s backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength , but instead it ' s an act of desperation . ""

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - a collapse of market
confidence could hurt the credit quality of energy trading
giant enron corp . , but its bonds are not likely to end
up in junk territory , fixed - income research service gimmecredit
said on monday .
moreover , enron ' s bonds could be undervalued if the
company ' s off - balance - sheet obligations amount to no more
than $ 3 billion , as reported , gimmecredit said .
"" worst case , enron doesn ' t look like a junk credit , ""
gimmecredit analyst carol levenson said . "" but perception is
all , and clearly both the stock and bond markets view enron
as being in dire straits . ""
enron ' s bonds fell sharply on friday after the energy
giant drew down about $ 3 billion from a credit line and
said it was in talks with its banks to obtain a new
multibillion - dollar credit line .
the company ' s stock has lost more than half of its
value in the last two weeks as investors questioned
off - balance - sheet transactions between the company and two
limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer
andrew fastow . the u . s . securities and exchange commission
is looking into those transactions for possible conflicts
of interest .
"" we admit management ' s financial disclosure remains
woefully inadequate , "" gimmecredit said . "" however , botched
investor communication does not necessarily equate to
illegal or fraudulent behavior . ""
still , enron ' s move last week to draw down all of its
backup bank lines was "" an act of desperation , "" gimmecredit
said . the move eventually may lead to renegotiated bank
agreements , which could be more expensive and restrictive
and could also subordinate the position of bondholders , it
said .
"" on the plus side is our belief that management will do
everything in their power to preserve the company ' s
investment - grade ratings , "" the firm said .
another positive is a precedent the rating agencies set
with kmart corp . in the mid - 1990 s , when they tried to avoid
being the cause of a company ' s financial downfall , gimmecredit
said .
moody ' s investors service on monday cut enron ' s senior
unsecured rating to "" baa 2 "" from "" baal "" and kept it on
review for further downgrade . moody ' s said its actions were
prompted by deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility
since the company announced significant write - downs and
equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership
investments .
last thursday , standard & poor ' s revised its outlook on
enron to negative while affirming its "" bbb - plus "" long - term
rating .

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - enron corp . shares fell to their lowest level in almost seven years in early trade on monday following news that north america ' s largest natural gas and electricity trader was considering tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks .
enron shares were down $ 1 . 55 , or 10 percent , to $ 13 . 95 on the new york stock exchange . the shares have not been under $ 14 since december 1994 .
earlier , the credit - rating agency moody ' s investor service placed all long term - debt obligations of enron under review for downgrade following the company ' s announcement of significant write - downs and charges , reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses .
moody ' s said the actions affect enron ' s broadband operations , its merchant portfolio , and the azurix water company holdings .
last week enron shares lost almost $ 14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company ' s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out .
many industry observers see enron ' s request for additional credit , after the company tapped its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week , as a sign a weakness .

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - moody ' s investors service said it placed all the long - term debt obligations of enron on review for downgrade following the company ' s announcement of significant write - downs and charges , reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses .
the magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 pct while slashing earnings , moody ' s said in a statement .
the company ' s previously announced sale of portland general , however , will result in cash proceeds approximating 1 . 8 bln usd which management is earmarking for debt reduction . in addition , the sale will remove approximately 1 bln usd of debt obligations from enron ' s balance sheet .
however , moody ' s noted that , while this transaction will go a long way to help restore enron ' s balance sheet , it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year to complete .
enron has a baal senior unsecured rating .

enron shares fall after moody ' s cuts credit rating ( update 6 )
2001 - 10 - 29 16 : 46 ( new york )
enron shares fall after moody ' s cuts credit rating ( update 6 )
( adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper . )
new york , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares declined
a ninth day as moody ' s investors service lowered its credit
rating , raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day - to - day operations .
moody ' s lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt
ratings to ` ` baa 2 , ' ' two levels above junk , from ` ` baal ' ' and also
placed the houston - based company ' s ` ` p - 2 ' ' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade .
moody ' s may downgrade enron ' s commercial paper rating , which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short - term cash
needed to run its trading businesses . ahead of a potential cut ,
enron took out bank lines to repay $ 2 billion in commercial paper
last week , largely removing itself from that borrowing arena .
` ` they ' ve pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial - paper market , ' ' said shannon bass , who holds enron
bonds in the $ 50 million he helps manage at pacific investment
management co . ` ` the real issue now is trying to get their house
in order . ' '
pimco is ` ` well underweight ' ' enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to , bass said .
shut out
companies such as xerox corp . , which was shut out of the
commercial - paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced , were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash . investors in commercial paper , borrowings due in nine months
or less , also stopped buying motorola inc . and lucent technologies
inc . short - term debt , forcing the firms to restructure borrowing ,
sell assets , and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more .
enron shares plunged $ 1 . 59 , or 10 percent , to $ 13 . 81 ,
continuing a slide that dates back to oct . 17 , when enron reported
$ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading .
the stock traded near $ 90 in september 2000 and touched a
seven - year low of $ 13 . 55 today . enron has lost more than $ 50
billion in market value this year . on dec . 31 , the company had a
market capitalization of $ 62 . 7 billion . today , the market value
was $ 10 . 5 billion .
deterioration
while enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week , its
bonds are down about 20 percent . a company ' s stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid .
the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $ 1 of face value after the moody ' s downgrade .
yields have risen to 12 . 1 percent , up from 10 . 8 before that
downgrade , traders said . the bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before .
moody ' s said the cut was prompted by the ` ` deterioration in
enron ' s financial flexibility ' ' since the write - downs and charges .
the partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month , which ` ` led to a substantial loss in investor confidence , ' '
according to moody ' s .
` ` a credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power , ' ' said joe correnti , who follows enron for wayne
hummer investments llc in chicago . ` ` that ' s not a good place for
them to be . they have somewhat aggressive expansion plans . ' '
enron ' s recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit -
rating reduction . ` ` this move was anticipated , ' ' said mike dineen ,
who holds enron bonds in the $ 5 billion of fixed - income assets he
helps manage at mony life insurance co .
there are about $ 15 . 8 billion of enron bonds outstanding ,
almost $ 9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006 ,
according to bloomberg data .
cash needed
last week , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow
after the u . s . securities and exchange commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed . in august , jeff skilling quit as enron chief executive ,
eight months after taking the position , and chairman ken lay moved
back into the position .
enron is trying to get $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in loans from
citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and other banks to calm
investors , the wall street journal reported . the company ' s stock
has plummeted 57 percent since oct . 17 , when fastow ' s partnerships
were disclosed .
enron uses its investment - grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners .
` ` when you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings .
it ' s likely their trading volumes will go down ' ' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher - rated trading partners , said sean
egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . , which gives
enron ' s credit a junk grade of ` ` bb + . ' '
enron ' s long - term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by standard & poor ' s . s & p affirmed the firm ' s
rating of ` ` bbb + ' ' , the equivalent of moody ' s ` ` baal ' ' .
` ` we have been split - rated before and it did not affect our
growth , ' ' said karen denne , a spokeswoman for houston - based enron .
` ` we are still investment grade . ' '
enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( update 2 )

enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( update 2 )
( updates with closing share price in last paragraph . )
houston , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which can ' t get
low - interest , short - term loans , faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank , credit analysts said .
` ` anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous , ' ' said
sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . ` ` it ' s
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral . ' '
enron is trying to get $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in loans from
citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company ' s stock since
oct . 17 , the wall street journal reported . the company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners .
the company on thursday tapped $ 3 . 3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $ 2 billion in commercial paper ,
or short - term corporate loans . a week ago , the enron said the u . s .
securities and exchange commission had began an inquiry into
related - party transactions . they cost the company $ 35 million and
$ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity .
` ` banks are in the driver ' s seat , and enron is a little
desperate , ' ' said peter petas , a debt analyst at creditsights inc .
` ` i think their interest rates for loans would go up . ' '
sells assets for cash
companies in enron ' s situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans , petas said . those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral .
enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash . two related
partnerships , osprey and marlin , depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $ 3 . 3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants . enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds .
the company plans to complete the $ 2 . 9 billion sale of
portland general electric , an oregon utility , to northwest natural
gas co . next year .
shares of houston - based enron fell $ 1 . 59 , or 10 percent , to
$ 13 . 81 . the stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months .

moody ' s downgrades enron ' s debt

new york ( cbs . mw ) - shares of enron fell further monday after moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s long - term debt a notch .
enron , which hit a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 on dec . 29 , was well on its way to another year low monday . heading for a ninth straight day of losses , enron shed more than 9 percent , or $ 1 . 41 , to $ 13 . 99 . the stock was again the most active mover on the new york stock exchange as close to 28 million shares had changed hands .
moody ' s said it cut the senior unsecured long - term debt to baa 2 from baal , and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades . the action follows enron ' s reported $ 1 . 01 billion charge in the third quarter and was driven by the expectation of further write - downs and the swift deterioration of the company ' s financial picture , said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s .
"" however , we do feel the move enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move , "" said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s . the rating agency said it would review the prime - 2 rating on enron ' s commercial paper .
last thursday , enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $ 2 billion to pay down commercial paper .
the decision to pay off the commercial paper , he said , accomplishes two goals .
"" it increases liquidity on a short - term basis , and additionally , it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now , "" moore said . "" they are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business . ""
karen denne , an enron spokesperson , confirmed monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing . additional credit would help boost enron ' s liquidity position .
the lingering concern for moody ' s is that there "" yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of enron itself , "" moore said .
at the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships - - lmj and lmj 2 - created in 1999 by former cfo andy fastow and since dissolved . enron ousted fastow last week . see related story . "" the market was unaware , "" of the existence of the partnerships , moore said .
"" quite frankly , we don ' t think there is anything else , "" he said . "" but enron is huge , and if this could happen . . . there is a lingering concern that something else might happen . we cannot confirm or deny that this is true . we will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these . ""
moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week .
"" should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events , that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business , the enron engine , "" he said .
moody ' s action monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts - - marlin water trust and osprey , which have combined debt of $ 3 . 2 billion . marlin is now rated baa 2 , while osprey carries a new rating of baa 3 , both down a notch .
the potential issue for the trusts may be "" how much equity enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn ' t enough to pay off the debt . "" enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation .

enron goes begging
forbes . com staff , forbes . com , 10 . 29 . 01 , 11 : 40 am et
new york - enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit , as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six - year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with enron on hold . last thursday , the energy trader drew down about $ 3 billion from a credit line , causing its bonds to fall sharply on friday .
enron ( nyse : ene ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since oct . 16 - - after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years . the $ 638 million loss included $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . a week later , it disclosed that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . fastow was forced to step down from the company last week .
the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that enron ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling .
in these challenging times , enron deserves our thanks
houston chronicle , october 28 , 2001
by bill white
enron and its employees have blessed houston , and many houstonians should now take the time to say "" thanks "" when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges . enron attracted thousands of great people to houston and changed houston ' s economy forever . the company ' s management encouraged their employees to be active citizens , and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community .
enron ' s lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion - dollar new industry , with houston as its hub . even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace , enron ' s example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity . the downtown concentration of these firms - - industry leaders including reliant , dynegy , el paso and duke energy - - led london ' s financial times to refer to louisiana street as the wall street of electricity .
this explosive growth attracted bright young people - - with the average age of enron employees at under 35 - - and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in houston ' s downtown . this , in turn , helped revitalize downtown ' s retail and restaurant scene . enron ' s construction of a large class a office tower , still going up , is a milestone in houston ' s growth , an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space .
virtually every civic or charitable activity in houston learned to count on enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities . if enron or its chairman , ken lay , led a visionary effort , such as hosting the meeting of g 7 trade ministers , or more recently the private funding of the houston biotechnology center , houstonians knew it would be done right . without lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town .
employees know enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential , with no glass ceilings . women have run large divisions and subsidiaries . many military officers find that enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers , even at ages well past normal corporate entry level . the most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them .
enron ' s corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the american dream . with the habits of work learned on a family farm in missouri , ken lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the university of houston , served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business . when northern natural gas acquired the smaller houston natural gas , northern ' s chairman surprised folks by installing lay as his successor . i was at northern ' s headquarters in omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when northern ' s chairman reassured folks that they could count on "" best young executive in the business , ken lay , "" to direct their future in a changing marketplace . within 15 years , most of enron ' s revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when lay had taken over , all of which had been created from within the firm . this success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team .
enron rewarded innovation , while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded . year after year , top executives throughout the country voted enron our nation ' s most innovative corporation . enron recognized , even when financial markets do not , that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes .
rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace , as had many american businesses , enron welcomed the challenge of the international market , confident that american firms could compete and win . enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship , and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line .
enron ' s phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations , as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth , forever . enron ' s size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in california and india , even as enron supplied the electricity they so needed . sometimes it seemed the company ' s upstart origins as the david battling utility goliaths delayed the firm ' s perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog .
and so if enron experiences problems , it will learn from them , just as strong people do . let ' s not prejudge enron ' s current challenges . the more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story .
throughout its years of success , enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm ' s hometown of houston a better place to live and work . as enron enters a new phase of its life , let ' s not forget to express thanks and steady support .

"Subject: aggressive investors should be watching sports alumni , inc .
investor alert !
if a group of
investors would have the opportunity to have invest in the nba ,
nfl , nbl , nhl , and mls when the leagues started . how rich would
they be today ? today we will be introducing a new football alumni
association that will bring ex high school , college , and
professional athletes around the
united states
to relive
their glory days .
as savvy
investor prepare to buy this stock , it has become clear that this
could be one of the most explosive opportunities of the year . you
still have the opportunity to buy this stock for pennies to the
dollar - but for how long ?
here at wall
street research we do not get excited about many stocks . that ' s
because its getting harder and harder to find stocks that have
potential to make investors rich very quickly . blue
chips can ' t and ipo ' s rarely pay off small
investors . history shows that the only consistent way for small
investors to see their money double , triple , or more on the
short run is to be smart enough to find small caps with huge
potential and buy before they take off - the kind of stocks that
gets us excited .

sports alumni , inc
( spni ) ,
it is making big moves and growing fast ! when the
nba , nfl ,
nbl , nhl ,
and mls , talk about lockouts , half seasons or
no season , salary caps , and even the referees join the turmoil
every year one of these leagues threatens the passion
for sports ! . will they play again this season ? sports alumni , inc is
about bringing the passion of the former game to all ex high
school , college , and professional athletes . not about how
big of a salary they will be making the next couple of years .
sports alumni , inc
sports alumni , inc maybe you started playing football when you where
8 years old and never quite lost the love of the game . perhaps you
even played college ball . what ever level you played , its a good bet
that your passion for the game did not end when the whistle blew and
the last play ended . that is what american football alumni seeks to
bring back to the multi - million - member target market of former and
current players and coaches .
recent surveys reveal that 70 percent of former football players would
be interested in joining a national alumni association whose makeup is
former high school and college players . seventy - nine percent are
interested in reunions with former teammates and 55 percent said
they ' d be interested in purchasing their old school football jerseys ,
especially if their names were included .
the afa will bring old teams together through its subscriber network ,
while offering on line stores of customized merchandise , a first class
magazine , conventions , football travel packages national and local
polls . this is an un - tapped industry within a multi - billion dollar
marketplace .
companys recent news
sports alumni , inc . ( spni
pk )
announced today the official launch of their first sports alumni micro
site ,
www . . com . this
site is the preliminary sign up point for their first of many sports
alumni sites the company plans to launch this year . the main member
site launch is expected early july 2005 with a $ 30 million
media blitz to follow this fall . we are very pleased to have ai
software solutions as our software development and web hosting partner
as they are clearly one of the top companies in this industry and can
fully support our expected rapid growth . they have integrated
seamlessly with our organization and made development a snap , stated
sports alumnis president matthew totty .
sports
alumni will also be marketing football fest 2006 this fall , a grand
event planned in las vegas ,
june
2006 , where they expect attendance of over 150 , 000 former
players and coaches . we have everything imaginable planned for this
event and were really excited for this to be the football event in
the country to attend each year . its a chance for our members to
rub elbows with footballs greats and just have a good time . if you
lived it , youre one of us , states mr . totty .
smart investors know its easier to take a $ 1 . 00 stock to
$ 5 . 00 than to take a $ 10 . 00 stock to $ 50 . 00 .
but the word is
getting out . chances like this are few and far between and the buzz
on the street is that spni is a buy ! who knows when youll have
another chance to turn such a huge profit again ? smart investors
strike when the irons hot and with spni , its sizzling !

the enron management conference will be held wednesday through friday , november 14 - 16 , 2001 , at the westin la cantera resort in san antonio . while the business agenda is still being finalized , there is one thing that is certain . . . we want to inject some humor into the event . the past year has been eventful , and at times challenging , for enron and its employees . however , it ' s not in enron ' s corporate fabric to focus on the past . instead , we want to look ahead , and even laugh at ourselves . the management conference will provide a platform for just that .
we want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "" home video "" to be presented at the management conference . the video can address any enron - related topic that your business unit chooses . however , there are a few rules to follow .
1 . ) the videos should be no more than five minutes long .
2 . ) business units should spend as little as possible on the videos , and no more than $ 10 , 000 . innovision communications ( beth stier ) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original , inexpensive video . innovision can be contacted at 713 - 446 - 4424 .
3 . ) the videos should be fun , but not disparaging . they should adhere to enron ' s values of respect , integrity , communication and excellence .
4 . ) by monday , october 15 , business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video . to avoid duplication , business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address .
5 . ) to ensure inclusion in the management conference agenda , videos need to be submitted to me by friday , november 9 .
6 . ) awards will be given for creativity and humor . the first annual , and soon - to - be - coveted , "" enny "" will also be awarded for "" best overall video . ""
if you have any questions about the "" home video "" project , please contact myself or mary clark .

"Subject: california update 3 / 22 / 01
? the legislature will meet and vote to repeal section 390 of ab 1890 . this will reverse what the qfs get paid from natural gas costs and replace it with the formula in the governor ' s current plan - 7 . 9 cents / kwh for 5 - year contracts and 6 . 9 cents / kwh for 10 - year contracts . according to sources , this is "" locked in to pass . "" it will be implemented by a puc order on monday .
? the qfs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they would get paid . this plan would not generate enough money for many qfs to operate profitably . at least 2 , 000 mw of the total 5 , 407 mw of gas - fired qfs would be unable to generate a positive cash flow and would have to either operate unprofitably or shut down .
? the qf community is responding with an increased militancy for an involuntary filing , according to sources . the most aggressive qf after coram energy is david sokol and walter scott of mid - america energy ( based in nebraska ) . sokol is described by sources as "" extremely aggressive . ""

"Subject: organization announcement
enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned
subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has
conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner
allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their
requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however ,
with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in
internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change
its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically
sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are
significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial
potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business

"Subject: re : natural gas storage item
vince -
something very interesting about natural gas storage ( from the class ) .
the industry is rapidly adopting what are called "" operational balancing
agreements , "" where the pipeline contracts with the producers and ldc ' s
( public utilities ) to handle all "" imbalances "" in shipping , namely all
production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise . shippers then
always "" book "" what is scheduled to happen , and not what actually happens .
the end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions
are used to smooth out not only weekday - weekend seasonal patterns ( the
well - known "" parking "" ) but to insure issues of wellhead output as well .
cutting to the chase , storage facilities in producing regions are operated to
insure the integrity of the pipeline system , and estimated marketed
production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline ' s
receipt meter than is production less local storage .

"Subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to
assignment )
changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to
assignment )
fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,

we are set with a evaluation of the service covering the period from
monday to thursday july 31 to aug 3 . we will activate the web access on
friday afternoon and initiate calls monday morning . the call schedule is :
short range : 8 : 40 east coast time
mid range : 9 : 20 east coast time
if there is a conflict with these times , please notify me . we will need a
number to call into , typically we call directly onto the trading floor . the
username and password are the same as the initial viewing :
username : enron
password : stroso 0 ( zero zero )
it is important to make the point this is for evaluation purposes since we
are not under a contract with liability issues addressed .
i am sure enron will love it like the rest of our clients ! !

hi green roomers ,
the fall outdoor soccer season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the gpsd website at
http : / / www . gpsdsoccer . com /
you will be surprised to learn , like i was , that we were not promoted to the lst division . it seems that the league has decided to keep us in 2 nd even
though i registered for and said we would accept the promotion to lst
division in order to be eligible for the championship .
our first game is on sunday sept . 9 th at delta park # 8 ( ne of strasser ) at
12 : 15 . all of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at
12 : 15 and will occur every sunday between sept 9 th and november 18 th with
the exception of sunday october 21 st when we have a bye . we then will have
a championship game in early december since we will win the league again .
right ?
don ' t forget to update your player care if you had a recent birthday or are
new to the team . you update or get a player card at the oasa league office
off of highway 26 at the sylvan exit . they do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there .
anyway that is enough from me . see you soon out on the soccer pitch .

"Subject: i will be out next week
imbalances :
i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our
payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand .
again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but
things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this
imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ?
i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions :
how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ?
can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to
keith once we get the ar issue solved ?
where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ?
where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ?
duke energy 206 is still a problem .
do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large
number to me , can we net some of them ?
are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex
contract ?
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have
the right to use .
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf
energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ?
can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .
gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this
contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some
where we are owed ?
is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ?
where did the exxon imbalance come from ?
do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ?
can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ?
what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon ,
how old is this imbalnce ?
mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to
translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ?
i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can
we resolve this ?
i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to
have to work on a better way to check our positions .
i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james
mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with
the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we
need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .",0

"Subject: a few questions for you
hi louise
hope all is well and that your trip to and from london went smoothly !
a few questions :
1 . does enron have a system which collects data by customer ? we
have something called cmis which we use for these purposes and which i
believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don ' t
have something already . we usually need customer info for reg
reporting purposes .
2 . bob dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of
sorts whereat the heads of gas and power trading present to key ubsw
people what their businesses are all about , example trade flows ,
competitive pressures , key reg reporting requirements , etc . he would
also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what
they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets . the
thought is to try and do this on thursday because so many ubsw people
will be on the ground in houston for the simulation exercise . i don ' t
know that i am wedded to that day and i am a bit unsure about whether
this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration
but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and i
am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this
once they start trading . what do you think ?
the audience would include key logistics personnel from ubsw and enron
and anyone else you thought appropriate . spoke with mike about it and
he is fine .
3 . having ubsw paraphenalia sent down - toys , shirts , etc . , should
be arriving by no later than tuesday . if you haven ' t received anything
by late on monday could you let me know so i can track down . ubsw and
ubsw energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both
trading floors - they should arrive by wed .
4 . was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor
on friday to commemorate the closing . what do you think ?
5 . i am planning to be down in houston for most of next week . i
thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to
address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on friday . i
will be leaving on a late monday flight and returning on a late
afternoon friday flight . i hope you think this will be useful . please
let me know otherwise .
sorry for the long message . please feel free to call me at home or on
my cell if you have any questions , issues , would like to discuss h 914

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire )
new york , aug . 23 / prnewswire / - - electricity trading continued to move
online in the past six months , but most wholesale power deals are still being
done through traditional voice brokerages , the latest energy argus survey has
found . internet - based trading now makes up 38 % of trading in the us , up from
28 . 5 % in february and 25 % in april 2000 , according to argus data .
most online trading is done through either or
enrononline , each of which have more than a third of the electronic market ,
the survey of 40 power traders found . however , another 24 % of the
transactions are completed through a variety of other platforms , including
dynegydirect , bloomberg powermatch and tradespark .
although their market share has declined from 75 % two years ago , traditional
brokers continue to process most power trades , due to their ability to offer
options and other derivatives , their dominance in the short - term physical
markets and some trading houses ' reluctance to embrace online technology .

subject : hello from chicago
hey guys , i just wanted to update everybody on what ' s going on up here in
chicago . we ' ve finally got our computers hooked up , so we are off and
running now . actually , we got quite of few projects going on up here ( yes ,
these are real projects ) and we are going to need the houston structuring
group for support . i don ' t know if you guys are still short - handed and what
kind of projects you may already have lined - up , but i wanted list out some of
the projects that we are currently working on .
gas
lrg project - deirde is currently working on this with russell
nss storage - sean boyle helped value both their current and new nss . we are
currently working on negotiating with people ' s for these , and i expect that
there may be additional requests in the future .
manlove summer withdraw program - yes this is not a typo . surprise ,
surprise . . . manlove can do a lot more than we thought . i ' ve talked to
deirdre about it and created a simple model , but i would like to better
analyze this with your help .
capital improvements - we ' ve got people ' s christmas list of capital projects
that we are going to help them analyze and seek if any of these make sense .
sendout model - we would like to help them better optimize their morning
sendout taking into account current market pricing and the enron supply deal .
pbr - we are not sure when or if people ' s will file a pbr , but i think that
there are a lot of things that we learned during our previous experience that
we can do to help them prepare for a competitive marketplace ( ie transport
customers tariff restructuring )
pesc - people ' s is looking for assistance in understanding load following and
helping them build models to optimize their retail gas effort
san juan pricing - evan has been working with the desk to provide indicative
pricing with regard to pec hedging out some of their san juan production
reserves
power
power project development - we have several power projects underway and the
ctg group ( billy lemmons ) is helping us create necessary models
pesc - the retail power stuff lives . i ' ve think that fallon has a new
attitude on these deals and enron has committed to help them figure out this
market .
power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering
balancing / storage services for chicago area power projects . we would like to
have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor .
we have resources in chicago dedicated to these projects , as well as the
other stuff we ' re trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the
chicago back office function . we plan on adding our own structuring
resources ( in chicago or houston ) , but we felt that we ought to start by
figuring out what support the houston office will be able to provide . i will
be in the office this monday ( jan 17 ) , so i hope to be able to catch up with
you and discuss some of these items then . feel free to contact me if you
need to before then at 312 . 357 . 8876 or pager 800 . 778 . 0291 . thanks

"Subject: enron europe organisational changes
once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this
year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on
co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts
in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very
closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric
will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing
arcos .
we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination
responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti
will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric
shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and
portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .
the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread
position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility
for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more
likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas
markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and
the continental gas team .
ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power
transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will
pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,
and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to
eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission
responsibilities .
finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team
than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages
our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .
we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help
make these changes as smooth as possible .

"Subject: asalam ,
dear ,
i am mrs . suha arafat , the wife of yasser arafat , the palestinian leader who died recently in paris . since his death and even prior to the announcement , i have been thrown into a state of antagonism , confusion , humiliation , frustration and hopelessness by the present leadership of the palestinian liberation organization and the new prime minister . i have even been subjected to physical and psychological torture . as a widow that is so traumatized , i have lost confidence with everybody in the country at the moment .
you must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the discovery of some fund in my husband secret bank account and companies and the allegations of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in my name of which i have refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt palestine government .
in fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the government so far is in the tune of about $ 6 . 5 billion dollars . and they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life .
i have deposited the sum of 21 million dollars with a security financial firm in whose name is withheld for now until we open communication . i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your bank account for safe keeping and investment opportunity . this arrangement will be known to you and i alone and all our correspondence should be strictly on email alone because our government has tapped all my lines and are monitoring all my moves .
in view of the above , if you are willing to assist for our mutual benefits , we will have to negotiate on your percentage share of the $ 21 , 000 , 000 that will be kept in your position for a while pending when my daughter , zahwa , will come off age and take full responsibility of her family estate / inheritance .
please , if you are honest , i am going to entrust more funds in your care as this is one of the legacy we keep for our children . in case you don ' t accept please do not let me out to the security and international media as i am giving you this information in total trust and confidence i will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith and send to me your complete personal contact information .
may god bless you and your household .

i hope you ' re very well . as you can see , i am now working for the ft ' s
magazine publishing business ; i have responsibility for what ' s currently
termed
the expatriate division and i ' ve just passed my statutory probationary period
of 3 months . apologies for not contacting you sooner - but i guess you knew
you ' d hear from me sooner or later , especially when i need help ! having
gotten
thru probation , i am set loose upon new projects . . . . . . i ' m investigating
several
ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
one of them .
very basically , i want to develop a magazine product for the international
private investor , specifically
o hnwis
o owner - managers
o results - oriented but intelligent investor with long - term investment goals
and
a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and / or brokers on
something approaching equal terms
the product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
themselves . the product would aim to cover the major asset classes , including
the "" wilder shores "" such as hedge funds and emerging markets . i am working on
a
portal site ( imaginatively entitled ftexpat . com ! ) , nested within ft . com , which
will launch in october ; international investment will be a significant channel
on the site , and a key distribution / marketing channel for this ( and future )
offering . at this very early stage i am testing out the reaction to the notion
of such a product - do you have one ? would you be able to suggest any other
contacts who might be willing / able to share their thoughts with me ? i know
it ' s
not bang in your sphere but i ' m hoping you ' ll be interested enough to share
your thoughts with me .
if you can give me a few pointers , i ' d be grateful . looking forward to hearing
from you ,

 named derivatives exchange of the year
atlanta , ga ( january 23 , 2002 ) - , one of the world ' s most liquid and fastest growing commodity marketplaces , has been named derivatives exchange of the year for 2002 by risk magazine . the risk awards recognize excellence and innovation in the fast - changing risk management and over - the - counter derivatives businesses . intercontinental was selected for its phenomenal performance in 2001 in light of the difficult year experienced by many trading platforms in the global energy sector .
"" the intercontinental organization has experienced a tremendous year , "" said jeff sprecher , ceo of , who was also recently named as one of the top entrepreneurs of 2001 by businessweek magazine . "" to be named derivatives exchange of the year is a testament to the extremely talented group surrounding me at intercontinental , who are successfully advancing a very powerful business model . ""
intercontinental experienced tremendous growth and reached numerous milestones in 2001 . with the acquisition of international petroleum exchange of london ( ipe ) , europe ' s leading energy futures and options exchange , ice added a broad range of exchange - traded energy - based futures and options markets to its extensive roster of energy and metals - based over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives markets .
in august 2001 , intercontinental signed an agreement to offer optional clearing services to its otc market participants with the london clearing house ( lch ) . with this service , intercontinental will be uniquely positioned to offer market participants the option to utilize clearing services for global energy and metals transactions .
coupled with the july 2001 closing of its acquisition of the ipe , intercontinental will
be the world ' s first exchange organization to offer a full spectrum of risk management products ranging from traditional bi - lateral otc agreements to cleared otc products to exchange - traded futures and options on futures .
the past year also saw intercontinental make its move into the european otc gas and power markets with the introduction of markets for uk natural gas - related products in december 2001 . to support this expansion , ice entered into agreements
with a number of leading firms engaged in the sale and trading of uk natural gas .
in addition to expanding its product offerings in 2001 , intercontinental experienced
rapid and substantial growth . the past year saw intercontinental increase the number of participating firms and users by more than 400 % . equally impressive , the number of trades executed on the exchange grew 15 fold over that same period .
intercontinental will receive the award at the risk awards presentation dinner on
february 28 th in new york . the proceeds of the dinner will go to risk waters group world trade appeal fund .
about
 is one of the world ' s most liquid and fastest growing electronic commodity marketplace , owned by over 100 of the world ' s leading energy and metals traders , brokers and bankers .
the exchange electronic trading system is installed on over 7 , 500 desktops worldwide from which traders log on each day of the business week to trade more than 600 listed commodity and derivative contract types . broadly , these include crude oil and refined products , natural gas , power , precious metals and emissions allowances . contract forms include physical delivery as well as financially settled swaps , spreads , differentials and options based on a variety of fixed and floating price indices .
based in atlanta ( and with offices in new york , houston , chicago , london and singapore ) , this electronic exchange is taking the technological revolution that occurred in international financial markets and extending it into global commodity markets .
 is the owner of the international petroleum exchange of london ( ipe ) , europe '
leading energy futures and options exchange . the ipe provides highly regulated open outcry and electronic marketplaces where industry participants use futures and options to minimize their price risk exposure in the physical energy market .
products traded on ipe include brent crude futures and options , gas oil futures and options , natural gas futures and electricity ( baseload ) futures .",0

"Subject: status of reporting
at the request of the financial council during its last meeting , the coe
established a swat team to assist the business units in sap reporting . this
is the first of weekly status reports that we will provide .
purpose :
the team has begun to hold small , interactive workshops with production users
to :
show users how to extract data from sap by :
using on - line inquiry
using sap standard reports and
creating and modifying a variant
educate users on the sap data model and where business unit specific data
resides in sap ( which module ) .
better understand what additional reporting needs users may have .
team structure : lead : kim lesley ( consultant )
ps : andreas kraus ( coe ) , damon willis ( consultant )
fi / co : randy parman ( coe ) , esther cortes ( consultant )
education support : maria young ( coe )
the structure of the team reflects the initial focus on project and financial
reports . it has been balanced to include coe support analysts who will
provide long - term customer support plus sap consultants with deep reporting
knowledge . we will adjust the team members as appropriate to address the
material needed by the business units .
in addition to this team , susan bellinghausen and emitra nelson are
continuing their efforts on 1 / 1 , 4 / 1 and 7 / 1 report development .
progress :
to date we have held 5 workshops with the apachi and south american regions .
these workshops have been evaluated across several criteria .
on a scale of 1 - 4 ( 1 = not at all and 4 = absolutely ) , the workshops have
received an average rating of 3 . 6 in learning reports and increasing comfort
levels . the workshops are definitely providing the one on one experience
that the users are requesting . they are also seeing and learning ( hands on )
various tools that are available to them to adjust the display of reports ,
query the data from each module and analyze the data . the sessions are also
helping to remove some of the fear associated with trying things in a new
system by providing helpful tricks and hints from the experts .
however , there is still a concern about increasing the understanding of where
data resides within sap . this is reflected in the average rating to the key
question "" can sap meet your needs "" being only 2 . 5 . we will further explore
why the users think this is the case and what they are not getting . we are
adjusting our sessions to address this and will continue to seek feedback .
upcoming key activities :
schedule the remaining international region sessions and the eecc home office
sessions . we have the participant lists and are working on logistics .
complete the analysis of the needs of the other business units in production .
develop a process to follow up on these sessions to monitor the learning
progress of the users .
begin to evaluate a cost center reporting tool that enron europe has deployed
in london .
i would like to thank the active participation of the business units in
identifying and providing the right group of resources to the sessions . if
you have any questions or comments , feel free to address them to melissa
becker , kim lesley or myself .

brent and sally ,
after speaking with richard burchfield and brian hudson , i thought that it
would be appropriate to update both of you and beth as to it ' s commitment .
richard asked that he send out the message and i agreed . one reason for
doing this was to show that the operations and it groups are working together
towards a common goal . the other reason was to ensure that i had it ' s buy - in
to completing this database in a timely fashion .
our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in ql
2001 . the actual roll out will happen in phases prior to january so that we
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture ,
valuation , and the necessary reporting and accounting tools . by using brian
hudson ' s it team i can be assured that the global needs are met .
i will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further ,

you asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the analyst prc
process . . . i thought i would share a few things with you . the primary
concern was that an individual was representing "" our "" people , and they 1 ) did
not know them 2 ) did not know what they did 3 ) probably could not adequately
answer questions about that person and his / her performance and job
responsibilities . although i think the manager ' s in my group did an
excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments ( the two analysts
rankings in our group did not change from excellent ) , they were really uneasy
about someone independent of our group representing them .
also , in general , it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages
about the "" third "" rotation and the option of going back to school , staying
with the company , etc . i think a good idea would be to provide some clear ,
written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going
to work going forward . it surer seems like it changes every 6 months . . .
hope this helps ! let me know if you have any questions .

hi ,
as a professional bulk mailer for 5 years . i made over $ 200 , 000 last 12 months selling only one product , "" the banned cd "" .
luckily for you , the ' bulker cd 2003 "" is now for sale ! i decide to sell all secrets how i made over $ 20 , 000 per month at home only few hours work .
why don ' t more people use bulk email marketing ?

johannesburg south africa
attn : sir / madam ,
urgent business assistance
first , i must solicit your confidence in this
transaction ; this is by virtue if it ' s nature as being
utterly confidential and top secret . though i know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you that
all will be well at the end of the day . we have
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this
transaction , as we have been reliably informed of your
discreteness and ability in transactions of this
nature .
let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you . i am mr . john numvette , a branch manager with
a big bank of johannesburg , south africa . i came to
know of you in my private search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle this confidential
transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum
of money to a foreign account requiring maximum
confidence .
the proposition :
a foreigner , late engineer johnson creek , an gold
merchant / contractor with the government of south
africa , until his death one year ago in a ghastly air
crash , banked with us here in south africa . , and had
a closing balance of us $ 26 . 5 m ( twenty six million , five
hundred thousand united states dollars ) which the bank
now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any
available foreign next - of - kin of the late beneficiary
or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust
fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college
here in south africa . fervent valuable efforts are
being made by the bank to get in touch with any of
the creek family or relatives but proved unsuccessful .
it is because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of late engr . johnson creek ' s
next - of - kin ( he had no known wife and children ) that
the management under the influence of our chairman and
member of the board of directors are preparing for the
fund to be declared "" unclaimable "" and subsequently be
donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition to
further enhance the course of arm building in africa
and the world in general .
in order to avert this negative development , some of
my trusted colleagues and i now seek your permission
to have you stand as a next - of - kin to late engr .
johnson creek so that the funds us $ 26 . 5 m would be
released and paid into your bank account as the
beneficiary next - of - kin . all documents and proves to
enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out
and more so we are assuring you of a 100 % risk free
involvement . your share stays while the rest would be
for me and my colleagues for investment purposes in
your country .
we have agreed that , the funds will be shared thus ,
after it has been transferred into your account :
20 % of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the funds . 5 % will be set aside for
reimbursement to both parties for any incidental
expenses that may be incurred in the course of the
transfer . 75 % to us the originators of the
transaction .
if this proposal is ok by you and you do not wish to
take undue advantage of the trust , we hope to bestow
on you and your company , then kindly get to me
immediately . i will like you to furnish me with your
most confidential telephone , fax number for further
information on the release and subsequent transfer of
the funds in your favour .
thank you in advance for your anticipated
co - operation .
yours faithfully ,
mr . john numvette

i just received a letter from ed abrahamson at the railroad commission ,
asserting that we have still not fully corrected or explained all of the
audit violations they previously alleged . i will have delivered to each of
you this afternoon a copy of the letter , to which we must respond by october
27 . the tone of the letter indicates some frustration on the audit staff ' s
part , and it will behoove us to try to get the remaining matters resolved
promptly .
i will be out of town monday , but i will have my assistant , monica jackson ,
set up a meeting for tuesday afternoon to discuss how we are going to satisfy
the commission regarding the remaining exceptions . in the meantime , please
carefully review each item and commence doing whatever needs to be done to be
in a position to finalize our response by october 26 , thursday of next week .
i think some of the fixes will be fairly easy , but others will be more
problematic . please provide this memo and a copy of the letter to anyone who

president and c . o . o . ,
enron corp .
dear jeff ,
this email is from robert jarrow ( cornell ) and myself ( joe cherian ) . i hope
you recall meeting / lunching with bob jarrow & me when you keynoted at my
1999 math finance day conference here at boston university . i wanted to
introduce you to skg inc . , a startup that is focused on providing an
innovative service to the electronic trading community . messers kuppuswamy
seshadhri , sriketan mahanti , and gaurav mallik are the principal founders
of skg , inc . bob jarrow and i represent the company ' s scientific advisory
board . nobel laureate robert merton , who also sat on our table during your
keynote address , very kindly serves as an ad hoc senior advisor to skg and
has been an invaluable resource to skg , including putting us in touch with
jp morgan . coincidentally , the c . o . o . of jp morgan capital corp . ed
colloton , in an april 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the c . f . o .
of enron online , whom he knows and at which he felt skg would have huge
value - adding opportunities . however , given ed ' s busy travel schedule , i
don ' t believe he has been able to do that yet . hence this joint decision by
bob jarrow and myself to send you this email .
skg ' s solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in
electronic trading of securities / commodities on ecns and atss ( alternative
trading systems ) . it achieves this through a process of "" strategic
negotiation "" using automated agents ( intelligent software manifestations ) .
our system should not be viewed as an ecn , but rather as an enhancement to
any extant trading system , be it an ecn , ats , clob , nasdaq , etc . our
initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading ,
e . g . bonds / equities , but our strategy is as much applicable to energy / power
instruments trading , high speed communications bandwidth trading , and other
web - based commodities trading , which we believe is of interest to enron
online .
skg is superior to existing solutions in the following way :
1 ) it considers multiple attributes , e . g . , price , time , volatility ,
bandwidth . ( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,
the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth
available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )
2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .
3 ) it is multi - lateral .
4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .
5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in
traditional markets .
currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at
fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,
salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,
citizens power , and a host of other folks .
we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any
other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .
skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your
representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in
a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange
something appropriate .
thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .
with warm regards ,

subject : unify ar - - sap plans
two years ago enron north america made a decision to use unify ar for cash
application rather than sap ar . we decided at the time that sap ar would be
kept in sync with unify ar by the unify / sap interface . we believe that the
business logic for that decision has changed , and are now recommending that
unify ar be permanently turned off and all ar functions be performed in sap .
i have briefly summarized the change in business situation below .
two years ago today
netting allowed by legal and credit only if netting contract was already in
place . netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible , regardless of
existence of signed agreement .
netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time . canada nets across
counterparties .
netting performed in physical only , financial settlements to maintain
separate net statement process . ena considering netting physical and financial
together .
all account coordinators were to apply their own cash . cash applied centrally in
power , financial and canada individual coordinators apply cash only in
physical gas .
cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team . cash is not being
applied meaningfully at the line item level . the company has not made any
move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team .
the account inquiry functionality in unify was thought to be a key on - line
tool . old habits die hard . . . most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing
data , rather than using the on - line functionality .
overapplication of cash was not to be allowed . overpayments would be
classified as "" on account "" , with issues tracked in a case management system . case
management system does not exist . allowing overapplication helps the account
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account .
the counterparty / legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the
counterparty / legal entity combination on the enron invoice . given the number of legal
entities enron has , along with the number of entities our counterparties
have , this seems like a hopeless battle . allowing cross - application of cash
seems easier .
corp required that intercompany settlements had to be "" settled "" with cash
movement . corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be "" settled "" with cash
movement .
converting to sap ar simplifies the unify / sap interface in the following ways :
bank deposits into sap do not have to be split off into unify
cash entries in unify do not have to be interfaced back to sap
unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to sap
payables information does not have to be interfaced from sap to unify
given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face
two problems in unify .
controls built into unify are already obsolete .
unify does not maintain all products in one database , making efforts to net
across products in the future ( physical with financial , for instance )
impossible .
our understanding of the netting process in sap indicates that there are no
controls ( which sounds good at this point ) and that we would retain the
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable
within sap . however , we emphasize that netting would be done in sap , not at
the time of finaling a payment in unify .
to repeat , we are recommending that unify ar be turned off and we convert to
sap ar . we will schedule a meeting the week of february 22 to discuss .
please call me at x 33179 with any questions or comments . we will make this
decision by february 28 because the sap timeline does not allow any
additional time for consideration .

so the scoop is he is average .
he recently moved out of bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into continental power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks . is it a problem with the business or him ?
he worked for marcello romano ( head of bandwidth trading in europe ) as john knows . marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge . if marcello were to run uk gas again he wouldn ' t take him - as he is not sharp . so he wouldn ' t bother to move him across the atlantic if it costs a lot .

"Subject: contstraints on the shape of a smile
stinson , vince , zimin ,
here ' s a brief document on constraints on the shape of a smile for a fixed
expiry date .
the constraints are neccessary and sufficient for no arbitrage in this case .
i ' ve used a template created by dr . leppard which is why it looks so scary .
if you need constraints in the time direction then i will have to think a
little bit more about it .
i think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e . g .
stochastic volatility and local volatility models
will throw up different constraints .
steve ,
i am not sure if our traders ( or quants for that matter ) are aware of these
constraints
and some desks are beginning to build smiles . . .

thanks for your front - end research on this . it ' s too bad that the training
provider can ' t be as responsive ! in a trading organization , 2 to 3 months is
an eternity . sounds as if they are inflexible as well . our audience for
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders , so 2 days away
from the desk is not very workable either .
after i get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility , i may want to
book them for september , although with a much smaller audience than would be
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery .
could i get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this
decision ? thanks . - - sally

sally ,
angela sprock forwarded your vm to me regarding the var training that you
were looking to set up for your group .
i ' ve taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them
about the request and their availability . as well as discussing putting on
the 2 day course solely for you group , i also discussed with them the
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter modules . although
they considered this , they are insistent that the course structure , the
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format .
they are a very busy company , in much demand both within enron and other
companies . their earliest available dates are : september 14 - 15 , and september
21 - 22 .
alternatively , they have more flexibility on dates later in the year ( october
onwards - but that may be less of a fit ) .
how does this fit with your group ?
let me know if you want to discuss this further

i want to keep you informed .
this year all baskets will be done in a timely manner .

"Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01
executive summary
? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts .
? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table :
puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value
? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing utility .
? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some details :
of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this summer
some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months
none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot market
? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly announce a 10 % rate hike .
? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal .
pg & e
transmissions deal
one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now .
pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings . but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then pg & e will be left holding the bag .
thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .
the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative . remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution .
on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives
the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads .
? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 % above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done , anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .
? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .
? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving .
thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they come up with something even more outrageous . ""
pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .
davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year
while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires . that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .
ferc
the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .
one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and one of them "" could easily become chairman .

subject : equity investment fair value in turkey
vince ,
john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and
potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with
in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which
is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which
discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to
value these options
first , some additional information .
option characteristics :
- - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )
- - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated
- - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or
turkish lire )
we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75
per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on
december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at
$ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due
to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise
all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early
oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .
we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to
use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s
historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use
( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )
a few key points :
- - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to
be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future
options intrinsic value in 3 years
( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but
the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )
- - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return
- - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount
- - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we
obviously do not exercise .
we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach
our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market
and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing
that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the
non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel
rac ' s approach is double counting .
if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a
call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information .

hi stinson , as per our discussion , which we will expand upon when we meet
later today , my currently role in hamachi is better characterize as
combination of deal support ( from the engineering perpsective ) , facilitating
my work with jean mrha ( via erik simpson ) on the initial load forecast and
general requirements document development . none of this is technical by any
means . if anything , it is more like engineering consulting ( from deal
perspective ) by ebs research to john ' s group . i will bring it up with john
tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that
they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling
work may need to be done . for this i will use samer and / or chonawee but we
need to be certain that they are available on such on - call basis as stated
below . john is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such
meeting and when , etc . normally he does not want any deviations . so if we
put someone on such jobs , they have to be able to travel on - call anywhere ,
any place . that is the time pressure he is working with .
he want me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort . but i will
ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged
in etc . . .
i will recommend this to john for the next deal that he is planning .

to all :
i was very optimistic in my target of getting the level b estimate ready by sept 21 .
based on the amount of work that will need to be done to get a decent + / - 10 % estimate , i agree with norm ' s assessment and therefore the best we can hope for is a sept 29 / 01 completion .
we will endeavor to do our best .
thank you

a preliminary model has been developed based on the limited information doug , kevin , and i discussed yesterday . a finished product won ' t be complete until such time as elevations are verified along the new pipeline route . topogaphical maps are required to complete this portion of the study . once this is completed and studies run , that product will be reviewed by the planning team and system optimization team . studies will be based on the results of the open season and the volumes anticipated by marketing . expansion facilities will be adjusted based on those results and finished porduct produced .

we have a procedure in place with planning that any level b estimates that are major expansion projects , such as this , require at least one month to complete , after we have a defined scope of work from planning .
kevin , we realize your goals , but for us to do a proper level b with all of our due diligences , it won ' t be ready before sept . 29 th , at the earliest . especially if the hydraulics ( which are part of the scope ) aren ' t done until after sept . 12 th from planning . thanks , norm

based on scaling the topo maps i have , the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed .
transwestern mainline - 36 "" loop
compressor station # 2 to el paso take off point - 33 . 6 miles or say 34 miles
new lateral - 30 "" or 36 ""
a compressor station # 2 to phoenix storage cavern along i - 17 highway route - 144 miles + 5 % contingency or say 151 miles
b el paso take off point to phoenix storage cavern along el paso pipeline route - 120 miles + 5 % contingency or say 126 miles
in summary , the new lateral using the el paso route is 25 miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain , but will require the 34 mile extension on the transwestern loop .
i will flly both routes on sept 11 and examine any other options from the air .
i will drive as much of the routes as i can on sept 12 and evaluate on the ground the soil / rock conditions .
after this asessement , we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue .

"Subject: strange bedfellows
senators dianne feinstein and gordon smith
announce partnership in response to the western energy crisis
march 15 , 2001
washington , dc - senators dianne feinstein ( d - ca ) and gordon smith ( r - or ) today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the western energy market by directing the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) to impose a temporary "" just and reasonable "" wholesale rate cap or cost - of - service based rates .
the legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pass on the cost of the electricity to retail customers . however , the states would be able to determine how and when this would be done . in other words , california could choose to use tiered - pricing , real - time pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through .
"" we now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energy costs , "" senator feinstein said .
"" ferc has found the wholesale prices being charged in california to be unjust and unreasonable . this legislation essentially will mandate that once ferc makes such a finding , the agency will carry out its regulatory role . this is a $ 175 million a year agency . it is there to regulate the energy marketplace , and it should . what the federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis . unfortunately ferc has refused to do so . ""
"" california ' s broken electricity market is a result of a flawed 1996 california law that deregulated wholesale costs , but left in place caps on retail prices . this was coupled with a requirement that the utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market , where prices have escalated dramatically . in hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario , so that today , california buys electricity at astronomical prices . we believe that ferc needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace .

i was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity
locally was ok , but that hedging had to be done with regional hub . the
problem with this model is that it describes helsinki before the bust !
another possiblity is the agency model , where the local trader acts under the
direction of the hub trader . this is where helsinki currently is ( although we
also have an independent manager on site ) . however , i am not so happy with
this , and rick causey certainly does not like it . perhaps we should recommend
independent risk managers in every office , but all correspondence and
settlement with regional hub ?",0
"Subject: four new graphs
we have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the
dpr :
return on var ( rovar )
curve shift p & l ( delta - gamma ) sharpe ratio
risk - return ( large )
risk - return ( small )
all of these graphs deal with the concept of risk - adjusted return . the
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics . furthermore ,
enron ' s appetite for risk also differs in each market . as a result , it is
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms . therefore , the approach of
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk , in effect restating
return numbers into a standard base ( how many dollars we earn for every
dollar we put at risk ) .
for each business unit or commodity group , the rovar graph shows an average
of daily total p it shows an average of
daily curve shift p & l ( both delta and gamma ) divided by its standard
deviation . this sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non - trading p & l ( like new
deals , reserves , and so forth ) . furthermore , whereas var is a forward
looking statistic ( the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given
probability ) , standard deviation is backward looking ( the actual volatility
of our returns over the period ) . this graph also has two bars for every
business unit or commodity group : a dark brown on the left showing the sharpe
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis , and a light brown on the right showing the
ratio on a 1 week basis .
the curve shift p & l sharpe ratio and the rovar graphs complement each other
well . they measure different things , but if our p & l is composed mostly of
curve shift , and if our var closely predicts curve shift volatility , the two
statistics should be very close .
sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the p & l relative
to the risk . we therefore put together the risk - return graphs . on the
vertical axis , they show 4 week rolling average p & l . on the horizontal , they
show 4 week rolling average var . the various business units are plotted as
points on the graphs . these graphs are closely related to the 4 - week rovars ,
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is
the business unit ' s rovar ( average p & l / average var ) . another way of
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin
( 0 , 0 ) with the plotted point of a business unit is its rovar . books with
small risks and returns ( < $ 2 million ) are plotted on the "" small "" graph , and
the rest , on the "" large "" .
these graphs are based on the dpr database that we built to standardize and
capture the information that is reported in the dpr . most , but not all of
the information in the dpr currently flows from the database . as a result ,
we do not have rovars or sharpe ratios for every business unit . as we
continue to set up exports into the database , we will fill in the missing
numbers .
we will e - mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the
intra - net . please remember to launch the file in excel , instead of using the
lotus notes viewer . the var limit usage graphs that we created last week are
already on the web . we hope that you find all of these useful .

"Subject: california update 3 / 26 / 01
executive summary :
- cpuc likely to pass rate hikes tomorrow , politicians bowing to the inevitable
- many questions still unanswered , most notably size / structure of rate increase and past utility debts
- past undercollect major sticking point , with little help available from transmission deal or long - term contracts
- reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders ; large generators increasingly angry with davis ' "" blame game ""
- qfs waiting for details of rate hike ; new price formula crucial to socal ' s ability to make payments
- bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex , but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure
in our late friday report , we wrote "" davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort , but this action would not address the undercollection issue . there is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators , commercial paper holders , and ( less now but still very possible ) the qfs as time is running out . "" events are unfolding exactly along these lines .
1 . why rate hikes now ?
cpuc president lorretta lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes . davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution , but that there is a potentially painful political price attached . davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system , passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users .
other california politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes . the calenergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors , who are now able to sell outside the state , if they can get similar relief from the courts . and it ' s not just the qfs - - the giant reliant energy is appealing to the ninth circuit court in san francisco against federal judge frank damrell ' s series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to california .
2 . what impact will the rate hikes have ?
rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward , but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts . some form of rescheduling is a possibility , but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities - - if they don ' t seek protection from creditors themselves .
3 . undercollection / net short still unaddressed
all of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan . still , the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well . the bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the dwr , then to the commercial creditors . absent the transmission line deal , the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect . long - term power contracts are still relatively meaningless until 2003 , when the majority of the contracts kick in .
4 . large power suppliers losing patience
relations are also deteriorating between davis and the large power suppliers . davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations , talking to several of the main ceos almost daily . but state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves . this is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes . if reliant loses their case , it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy . what ' s more , financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience , and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy . pg and ( 2 ) many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action . it is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached , but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy .
other bullish news : pg & e gets extended forbearance until april 13 th from its banks , and socal announces that it will pay some qfs . the actual amount of payments to the qfs is still subject to the cpuc approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the qfs . that decision should come tomorrow .
6 . outlook
last week we wrote that "" the qfs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood , what they can get from the cpuc hearing next week . "" the next 48 hours will be crucial . only massive rate hikes ( 40 % or higher roughly ) would address the undercollect issue and davis is unlikely to authorize those .
as one source told us , "" the age of denial is ( mostly ) coming to an end , and that is the main source of hope that california can begin to move forward from this . "" but the situation is so complex , and there are so many players and angles involved , that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure .",0

nick ,
thanks for your message . my family is in houston for the christmas holidays
and this means i am not coming any time soon to stanford .
i shall probably visit the campus for the parents weekend . let ' s
plan to meet for dinner then .
i am very glad that you have recruited the 2 nd phd student for the research
project .
we are discussing internally what would be the best topic ( s ) for the project
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it .
it makes a lot of sense for you to visit enron to finalize the selection
of the research topics .
we shall be glad to take both eric and giuseppe as summer interns .
everybody was immensely impressed with giuseppe and we shall
welcome him with open arms .
i shall get in touch with you in the beginning of january to finalize the
arrangements for your trip and our meeting at stanford .

hello vince and stinson ,
first of all ,
best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !
if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together
some time to have dinner .
i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is
eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !
we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would
hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into
the "" problem / opportunity generation environment . "" that really helps the
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research .
perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter ,
say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of
course
you could visit us before that too .
with my warmest wishes ,

"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

two sections totaling 1280 gross acres overlying the vast viking gas target . the

since 1972 . the porous sand ranges from 30 feet to 46 feet thick and
contains gas under lain by water . pay zone thickness ranges from 4 feet to
12 feet with a proven and probable recoverable reserve of 8 bcf at a market

subject : update on srp margin call
importance : high
tim ,
as you know , srp made a margin call to epmi on monday , by letter , seeking $ 5 . 5 million in margin under a "" one - off "" contract . tracy and i sent a letter back on tuesday , arguing that the contract does not permit srp to call for additional margin unless ene is downgraded to junk status . srp responded to our letter this afternoon . predictably , srp disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin . srp says that it will treat our failure to post $ 5 . 5 million by monday , november 12 , in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit , as an event of default and will terminate the contract . if this happens , epmi would have to make a payment of $ 5 . 5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from srp .
as you know , tracy and i strongly believe that the contract does not support srp ' s right to call for margin at this time . however , the contract is not perfect ( they drafted it , after all ) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position .
i recommend that we treat the srp - epmi dispute regarding the margining criteria under this agreement as a "" dispute "" under section 17 . disputes are first submitted to authorized representatives ( each company designates an authorized representative ) to resolve . if the authorized representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days , then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at srp ( the "" executives "" ) . the executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue . if the executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days , then both parties can choose arbitration , or either party can take the matter to court . in summary , best case , this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate / litigate the issue . otherwise , we better prepare to post collateral monday .
if you want to handle this matter by taking the "" dispute "" route , i should send a letter out tomorrow to srp giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract ' s "" dispute "" provisions .
steve
( i should also mention that tracy has informed me that srp plans to issue a margin call on our wspp contracts ( approximately $ 4 . 5 million ) as soon as it calculates the amount due . )",0

steve ,
i submitted my evaluation . general impression was rather
negative : he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth
and technical details .
he is personable , outspoken , organized - on the positive
side .
also , the red flag is that he jumps from job to job : typical after
18 - 24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness .

hi vince ,
what did you think of david hsu ?
my thoughts .
overall a good guy . personable . intelligent .
he could communicate reasonably well , but seemed to be capable of losing
objectivity in favour of technical advancement .
he didn ' t seem comfortable with taking a man - management role ( at least he
didn ' t want to be an ' administrator ' )
he appeared to know a lot about risk . ( in fact jay web called me to say he
felt david was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull ) .

enron ' s departure from core business
takes a toll on performance
by will mcnamara
director , electric industry analysis
[ news item from reuters ] enron corp . ( nyse : ene ) stock sustained further heavy losses on october 19 as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years . the energy giant ' s stock was off $ 3 . 32 or 11 . 45 percent at $ 25 . 68 per share at mid - day trade on oct . 19 , making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million . as of early morning trading on oct . 22 , enron shares were priced at $ 21 . 99 , a reflection of new developments ( including a new securities and exchange inquiry ) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors .
analysis : enron ' s first financial report since the departure of former ceo jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company , which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory . while skilling cited personal reasons for his departure , many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enron ' s share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role . at the time of skilling ' s departure , enron ' s stock had tumbled to a 52 - week low . however , based on the new 3 q report , it now appears that enron ' s downward turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the company ' s top spot . in essence , enron ' s financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales . it appears that enron is learning a costly lesson - namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company ' s innovation , especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised . the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron , as a good number of unresolved issues and a new securities and exchange commission ( sec ) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company .
let ' s first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the third quarter . as noted , as a whole the company reported $ 638 million in losses , after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges associated with several of its non - core businesses . when we break down the losses , it becomes clear that enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses : water , broadband and the retail power market . specifically , enron reported $ 287 million in charges from azurix , its water and wastewater business ; $ 180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations ( including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts ) ; and $ 544 million in what the company is calling "" investment losses . "" evidently , about half of the $ 544 - million figure is related to enron ' s investment in newpower company , the retail electricity and natural - gas provider that enron launched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm . enron owns 45 percent of newpower . in addition , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent , although lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002 . however , it is important to note that enron ' s 3 q recurring net income ( before the write - offs ) did increase 35 percent to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a diluted share , and revenue in the quarter rose to $ 47 . 6 billion from $ 30 billion in 3 q 2000 .
the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting . as one of the leading investors in the company , enron drove newpower ' s aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales , despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the united states . newpower went public last year at an opening price of $ 21 , and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price . however , the company ' s stock has experienced a devastating drop in value , and is currently priced at $ 1 . 25 . newpower is not scheduled to release its own 3 q financial statement until early november , but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future . specifically , newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3 q loss of $ 65 million to $ 70 million , or $ 1 . 12 to $ 1 . 20 a share . third - quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $ 60 million to $ 65 million that the company had forecast in august .
in analyzing newpower ' s 2 q financial losses ( see issuealert from 8 / 8 / 01 at www . scientech . com / rci ) , i argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the united states . on the positive side , newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts , most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from aes corp . and dte energy . these purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for newpower , and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states . however , the bad news for newpower is that its losses continue to widen , apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates . this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better , and the company ' s stock has continued to drop as a result .
in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes , newpower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp . and several of its subsidiaries . the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries through jan . 4 , 2002 . with the lowered financial obligations that it must make to enron , newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset - based financing .
however , from enron ' s perspective , the losses associated with newpower ( and , by the same token , the losses in water and broadband ) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price . the message is clear : the businesses that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole . further , what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enron ' s part has not translated into measurable profits , and consequently wall street has reacted by sending enron ' s stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago . the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all unique , but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from what was a successful core business . further , they are similar in that enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth . the problem with enron ' s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber - optic lines , which has prevented the demand for the division ' s services from materializing as anticipated . the problem with azurix , which has been losing money since its formation in 1998 , is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies anticipated . in addition to these problem areas , enron also faces challenges related to its investments in india ( where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government ) and california ( from which enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales ) .
in addition to the losses outlined in the 3 q report , there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week . first , the sec has requested that enron provide information regarding "" certain related party transactions . "" not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry . however , it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of enron ' s chief financial officer andrew fastow , who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from enron . ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the sec ' s request . in a separate development , several mutual funds ( including aim constellation that once held large positions in enron ) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company , which has further weakened enron ' s stock value . portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about enron ' s ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader .
the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses . thus , lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company ' s energy and gas - pipeline business are still strong . further , lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to "" clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses . "" nevertheless , the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort , and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well . thus , several questions remain at this juncture . are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading ? or , will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002 ? moving forward , will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably ? only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at enron , which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change .

"Subject: the storage revolution has begun
network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo
on storage in the enterprise
today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun
03 / 07 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : the storage revolution has
begun
by amy larsen decarlo
believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution .
virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to
terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is
skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to
rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of
storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery .
it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that
are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies
place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound
effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant
storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their
employees , suppliers and customers .
but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average ,
double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months ,
companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the
proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for
the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ?
the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed
storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in
advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support
those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not
from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those
systems .
there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best
routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing
storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file
servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when
enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a
progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing
the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it
does with the physical location of the files .
next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally
important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary
by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make
storage implementation decisions based on business needs .
businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for
alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to
speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and
recovery operations from the lan .
network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one
answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to
stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years ,
are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better
performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network .
instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross -
platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments .
many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term
answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are
designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they
alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated
with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment
stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still
largely untested in a production environment .
this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management ,
it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery
to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the
least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will
look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging
technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues .
ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and
practices that work in real - world environments .

spoke to howard , he is intereste in speaking to someone higher up the

report into him . he really needs to speak to someone higher up and discuss
the roles strategic potential .
he is interested mainly in structuring which this role is not . but he
recognised where it might lead and this would potetially be interesting to
him but needs to speak to someone who is involved in the strategic direction
of enrons credit . com .
vuthy is aware that enron have intimated they want to see him again . howard
has told me there is a lot happening for him both here and in the us . vuthy

review of energy policies kicks off
asahi shimbun
april 25 , 2000
a government advisory panel on monday embarked on a
comprehensive review of energy - related policies .
` ` we want to come up with feasible policies and at the
same time clearly present reasons for those policies , ' '
yoichi kaya , a professor emeritus at the university of
tokyo , told a meeting of the coordination subcommittee
under the advisory committee for energy , an advisory
panel to minister of international trade and industry
takashi fukaya . kaya chairs the subcommittee .
the nuclear development policy , including the
government ' s goal for building new nuclear power plants ,
is expected to be a focus of the discussions .
a spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of
plants increasingly difficult , and the nation ' s power
suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power
plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20
to 13 .
the subcommittee , set up for the first time in about 10
years , is made up of about 30 members , and members of
anti - nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been
included for the first time .
some members told monday ' s meeting that the
government must stop taking the nuclear development
policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility
of introducing renewable energy , such as wind and solar
power .
also on the agenda will be energy saving measures .
energy consumption in the residential and commercial
sector , made up of homes and offices , and in the
transportation sector , which includes cars and trucks , has
almost doubled over the past 25 years .
at monday ' s meeting , many members stressed the need
to change public consciousness toward the use of
energy .
miti plans to present studies on how life would be
affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as
automatically turning off air conditioners at certain
temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle .",0

the senate rules committee just met . during the hearing , senate leader john burton stated that :
the senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval ( sb 78 ) .
the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess . that bill was unacceptable to edison and davis , which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday night .
if the senate proceeds as burton suggests , the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get davis ' signature .
burton generally sticks to his word . but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb 78 could squeak by . however , burton ' s comments in the rules committee certainly don ' t help 78 ' s chances for survival .
finally , the assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill , and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage . more information on the windfall profits bill as we get it .

the following is an update on ljm deal :
1 ) i participated on a conference call with aa ( jitendra and others ) and our
accounting / credit group ( wes , bill bradford and others ) yesturday , in which
we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year - end for
the puts we own .
2 ) a big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain aa the details of the
deal . little progress was made on achieving the meeting ' s goal .
3 ) apparently , accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts
value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed . that
line of action was implied on a pre - meeting we had early that morning . from
my understanding , accounting argues that we should not make any credit
reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year - end .
4 ) at a certain point jintendra suggested me to use a two factor
mc - simulation for calculating the position with credit risk . the approach is
actually a more simplified version of the model we have . i and nobody
mentioned the results we got from our 2 - factor model .
5 ) at that same afternoon i knew from accounting that we are in a process of
unwinding our position .
these are the main points . please let me know if need more details .

below is a brief summary of the bc election results and some analysis into the new political party ' s ' implication . as the new bc energy strategy further develops , we will provide a more detailed follow - up reports .
executive summary
? new democratic party sweeps election
? opposition within newly elected party possible
? campbell to consider dividing bc energy and mines portfolio
ndp election
as expected , the ndp was "" wiped out "" by the liberal party . at this point , the liberals have secured 74 of 79 "" ridings "" ( a "" riding "" is the bc terminology for an open seat ) , while the ndp has won only three . counting has not yet been completed in another riding , though it is expected to go to the liberals , as well . the final riding , in victoria , is disputed due to approximately 700 absentee ballots . the ndp is currently trailing the liberals by 50 votes . this dispute is not expected to be resolved until 29 may , when all absentee ballots will be counted . no other parties secured seats , though sources report that the greens acted as a "" spoiler "" for the ndp in several cases .
opposition party
sources speculate that it is possible that , due to the poor showing by the ndp , a new opposition might form within the ranks of the liberals . approximately five former members of the social credit party ( which was disbanded in the early 1990 s ) were elected to liberal seats . sources state that it is possible that these members could re - form the social credit party within the legislature to act as an opposition to the liberal government . sources also state that richard neufeld , as a former reform party member , might choose to join this opposition if it forms , though there is no read at this time as to how likely this is to occur . otherwise , due to the landslide , campbell ' s liberal government is expected to have a "" carte blanche "" to do whatever it wants .
minister of energy & mines
campbell is expected to focus on forming his cabinet first . there reportedly is a considerable pay gap between the cabinet and the "" backbenchers "" ( mlas ) , meaning that there is likely to be "" considerable jockeying "" for positions . however , there are 6 - 10 obvious contenders , including richard neufeld , who is likely to be named energy minister . sources report that campbell intends to reduce the size of the cabinet somewhat , though the size of the reduction is not known at this time . however , he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development , forming two separate positions . it is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio .",0

"Subject: re : amendment to im ii ppa
todd and louise ,
with respect to no . 1 below , i will check with mike curry to get his view on "" contract intent "" .
with respect to no . 2 and no . 3 , the answer is absolutely "" no "" as they are material changes to the contract that have significant value issues . since i personally requested these changes to the original contract ( in the negotiation process ) , i know what the contract intent was and continues to be .
if aep is still the equity buyer , they have complete control over the "" grid curtailment "" and associated termination risk in item no . 2 since they are the transmission owning utility in the region .
the total epmi ppa ( as of 9 / 17 cob ) value is currently $ 18 . 5 million . my estimate for ppa value erosion for amendments no . 2 and no . 3 is $ 8 - 10 million . obviously , the $ erosion value is somewhat subjective , however , the transmission risk / grid curtailment risk on this project is significant and the termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what could be substantial downside for epmi . the reason i had mike ensure this provision was in the current ppa was to shift some of that risk back to enron wind and now enron wind is trying to push it to the project lenders ( who also don ' t want the risk ) .

subject : re : amendment to im ii ppa
kevin ,
ewc requires three clarifications to the ppa in order to get the project financed and sold . all previously requested amendments proposed by the equity purchaser have been dropped , and ewc will take the resulting pricing reduction .
i want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are . these clarifications conform to the original deal and are not changes to the deal .
1 . banking provisions . ewc and epmi agreed that energy and renewable energy credits ( "" recs "" ) produced by the indian mesa ii wind generating facility in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would , on a cumulative basis , offset any deficiencies of energy and recs in subsequent years . section 4 . 04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carryover mechanism which was contemplated by the parties . ( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal
2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal .
3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project .
under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay .
from an enron perspective :
the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa
while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project .
if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earnings
the after - tax return to enron in a "" hold "" situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits .
it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value .

i would like to make the message even more clear . epmi will not be making any changes , amendments , clarifications , interpretations , etc . to the current indian mesa ii ppa . therefore , any proposed purchaser of the indian mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation .
i don ' t think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion . we will continue provide enron wind with the ppa value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction ( sale of company and / or sale of im project ) .
please feel free to call me to discuss ( 713 - 853 - 5035 )

we are not interested in these changes to the ppa . these changes will weaken the language in the contract for us ( i . e . improve it for aep that is probably why they are asking for the "" clarifications "" ) . i will be out next week on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to kevin presto . regards , - mike

subject : ecp / linden swaps
here ' s my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps :
as i indicated earlier , the original $ 32 mm was put on for the linden 6 expansion which never occurred .
the second swap of $ 350 mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from el paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly . this hedge does appear to have been set with the el paso payment stream in mind .
the original $ 32 mm of swaps did not provide a clean hedge to the remaining el paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the el paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer .
however , the $ 382 mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged .
it appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time , a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the "" dirty "" interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time .
given that the monetization never occurred , it does appear to me that the $ 32 mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note .
anyone have anything additional to add ? that ' s the best i could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures .",0

i left risk publications and moved to a charity . having been here for only a
few months , i have decided that this job is not for me ( i miss the buzz of a
corporate office ) and i have decided to move back into the corporate sector .
because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector , i am
very interested in moving into this area . i have always thought that it
would be great to work for enron because it is such a dynamic company and i
am planning to approach the london office to discuss any opportunities ,
which might be available . i am particularly interested in product marketing

whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in london .

it is anticipated that the fluxstar magnetic source of power will
provide an alternative source of energy and power for homes around
the world . the objective of this
technology is to eventually eliminate utility bills for the end
user .
global cedar : in
addition to manufacturing furniture , the company intends to sell
and distribute its proprietary product , the global cedar tree , in
order to foster the growth of plantations that provide timber for
construction , furniture building , wood pulp , and other products .
the tree grows well in a variety of climactic conditions , and the
plantlets contain no contaminants and are subject to no known

achieving growth levels of 30 - 35 feet in its first year alone !
after just the first year , the tree can be harvested and will
re - grow from the stump , providing multiple harvests for years . the
timber produced is excellent for fine furniture and other uses for
which the wood of fast growing soft woods is unsuitable . the
potential benefits of the tree are legion , from positive effects
on the ozone and a buffer against rainforest depletion , as world
demand for wood products continues to outpace world supply .

when enron ceo jeffrey skilling resigned abruptly in august after six months on the job , longtime chairman kenneth lay assured investors that ` ` there ' s no other shoe to fall . ' ' so much for the warning . on oct . 16 , the houston - based energy giant reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in write - offs . it also disclosed a surprising $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholder equity to help unravel complex transactions between enron and partnerships that until recently had been overseen by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . then , on oct . 22 , enron revealed that the securities & exchange commission is probing those fastow - related transactions . two days later , enron promoted jeff mcmahon to cfo and announced that fastow will take a leave of absence . the setbacks have lay , who has reclaimed the ceo post , scrambling . he must get operations back on track , fend off shareholder lawsuits , and , above all , rebuild credibility with investors .

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp shares were sharply lower , down more than 8 pct at midsession , as investors continued to fear that the company ' s dealings with the ljm partnership could bring heavy financial reprisals following the opening of a formal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission , dealers said .
at 11 . 55 am , enron was down 1 . 35 usd , or 9 . 57 pct , to 12 . 55 .
the djia rose 61 . 23 points to 9 , 136 . 44 , the s & p 500 gained 8 . 76 points to 1 , 068 . 40 points , the nasdaq composite climbed 23 . 02 points to 1 , 713 . 40 .
yesterday , enron announced the election of william powers jr to the board , to chair a special committee that will examine and take any appropriate actions with respect to transactions between enron and entities connected to related parties .
in addition to reviewing the transactions in question , the special committee is charged with communicating with the sec and recommending any other actions it deems appropriate .
while the investigation might take time to draw a conclusion , the immediate cash crunch enron has been facing is expected to be resolved , said merrill lynch analyst duane grubert .
one step in that direction came following enron ' s announcement that jp morgan and salomon smith barney inc have executed commitment letters to provide 1 bln usd in secured credit lines supported by the company ' s northern natural gas and transwestern pipeline assets .
over time , enron has several other options to raise cash , including cutting its 400 mln usd per year dividend , cutting back on its 1500 mln usd of capital spending , and monetizing its july 2002 right to convert debt into 11 . 5 million shares of eog , said grubert .
the danger for the company now is that a "" real or fabricated confidence crisis by enron ' s counterparties threatens near term strength of the merchant segment . competitors could get mean , and could prematurely shun enron , while trying to steal market share , "" he said .

new york , nov 1 ( reuters ) - merrill lynch on thursday said it lowered both its mid - term and long - term ratings for enron corp . , the no . 1 buyer and seller of natural gas , to "" neutral , "" from "" accumulate "" and "" buy , "" respectively , due to uncertainty about the u . s . securities and exchange commission ' s investigation into the company ' s financial dealings .
analyst donato eassey said in a research note that while he "" has not altered his view of enron ' s fundamentals or its ability to weather the long term storm , "" he believes the noise surrounding the sec ' s investigation will overpower any earnings analysis .
"" ultimate outcome and underlying fundamentals aside , we believe significant pressure and uncertainty will remain on enron until the investigation concludes , "" eassey said .
the houston - based company , whose stock has been sent into a tailspin by the probe , said on wednesday the informal inquiry by the sec had become a full - scale investigation of the company ' s finances .
the stock slumped $ 1 . 34 , or nearly 10 percent , to $ 12 . 56 in thursday morning new york stock exchange trade . in the past week and a half , the stock has dropped to nine - year lows while losing $ 17 billion in market value .

enron obtains $ 1 billion in financing to bolster credit facilities
11 / 01 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
houston - - enron corp . said thursday it has secured commitments for an additional $ 1 billion in financing from units of j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . as the embattled energy trader moves to supplement its credit facilities .
"" this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , "" said enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon . "" we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . ""
enron has seen its stock price plummet in a selloff sparked by a loss of investor confidence in the company following big third - quarter write - downs and the disclosure of an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . in morning trading on the new york stock exchange , enron ( ene ) shares were down $ 1 . 67 , or 12 % , to $ 12 . 23 . the stock has declined from a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 .
enron ' s new financing is secured by its northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . assets .
the financing news comes a day after the sec elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . a formal investigation involves the sec ' s enforcement branch going to the five - member commission and obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inquiry .
enron last week disclosed that the sec had contacted the company as part of what it described as an informal inquiry into the fastow - related partnerships . at the time , enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would cooperate fully with the sec - - a position the company has restated repeatedly since .
in turn , enron named william power a director and head of a four - member committee to look into the fastow - related transactions and other matters . power is dean of the university of texas school of law .
enron has consistently said its dealings with the fastow - connected partnerships were legal and properly disclosed to investors . according to enron filings with the sec , the company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and enron stock with entities related to the fastow partnerships . internal partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow , who was replaced as chief financial officer by mr . mcmahon last week , has consistently declined to be interviewed .

enron stock price plunges again

houston ( ap ) - troubled enron corp . said thursday it has secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral . but its stock price took another dive after rising a day earlier on takeover speculation .
in afternoon trading thursday on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down 9 . 3 percent , or $ 1 . 29 a share , at $ 12 . 61 .
after dropping to a nine - year low on tuesday , shares of the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the houston - based company was a takeover candidate .
but after the stock market closed for the day , enron announced the securities and exchange commission had opened a formal investigation into possible conflicts of interest .
the sec is apparently looking into dealings enron had with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was forced out last month as investors fled because of questions about the arrangements .
on thursday , enron announced its investment bankers had arranged for $ 1 billion in fresh credit lines that it planned to use partly to refinance maturing debts .
"" this is yet another step in our efforts to enhance market and investor confidence , "" said jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s new chief financial officer . "" we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . ""
late wednesday , enron said it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation . powers also was elected to enron ' s board of directors .
"" i have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors ' questions and concerns , "" said enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay . "" we will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the sec ' s investigation . ""
however , duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence .
"" with ( stock ) values this low , you ' ve got two camps of investors : guys that hate enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to enron , "" grubert said . "" it ' s led to the trading range being irrationally low and shares being oversold . it ' s not something the company wants . ""
enron ' s stock has skidded since the company reported a $ 638 million third quarter loss just over two weeks ago , dragged down by a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to various losses . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by fastow , who was ousted last week .
earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades .
since reporting its disappointing third quarter , enron had been negotiating to establish new credit lines .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s stock price surge , after two weeks of selling , was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report on rumors of a possible takeover of enron .
others might have been buying figuring the stock had hit bottom , she said .
on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 .
potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said .

houston - - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover .
shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . it is still down 69 percent since the company reported third - quarter earnings two weeks ago .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said .
on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 .
potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said .
duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit .
"" shell tried to be in the merchant energy arena and didn ' t really succeed , "" he said . "" to buy into an established franchise must be attractive to shell . ""
enron officials did not immediately return telephone calls wednesday .

enron gets new bank loans but its bonds fall further
by joe niedzielski

capital markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - word that enron corp . ( ene ) had secured $ 1 billion in fresh funds thursday did little to soothe prices on the company ' s outstanding debt securities .
similar to other companies like lucent technologies inc . ( lu ) that have faced short - term liquidity issues this year , enron was forced to put up its assets in order to secure the financing . and the new bank facilities leapfrogged in front of other creditors like senior unsecured lenders .
the houston - based energy and trading company said in a statement thursday that the new financing is supported by enron ' s northern natural gas company and transwestern pipeline company assets . jpmorgan and salomon smith barney were co - arrangers on the credit lines .
enron plans to use the proceeds to supplement short - term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations . the new $ 1 billion of secured credit lines with the more than $ 1 billion in cash currently on the balance sheet "" will further solidify enron ' s standing as the leading market maker in wholesale energy markets , "" kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said in the statement .
but the need to pledge assets to get the credit lines shows caution on the part of lenders that ' s understandable given enron ' s situation , said susan abbott , a managing director in corporate finance at moody ' s investors service .
"" it signals the fact that the people with the money are not confident enough to trust the general corporate creditworthiness of the entity they ' re loaning money to , "" abbott said . still , by securing the $ 1 billion , enron avoided a negative signal that it couldn ' t secure financing , she said .
moody ' s lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt rating monday to baa 2 from baal . the debt is rated triple - b - plus by standard joe . niedzielski @ dowjones . com

enron gets $ 1 bln loan to boost cash , credit rating ( update 3 )
2001 - 11 - 01 11 : 40 ( new york )
enron gets $ 1 bln loan to boost cash , credit rating ( update 3 )
( adds possibility of additional loans in 12 th paragraph . )
houston , nov . 1 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest
energy trader , received a $ 1 billion loan from j . p . morgan chase &
co . and salomon smith barney inc . after agreeing to use the
company ' s natural - gas pipelines as collateral .
proceeds will go for debt payments and to supplement enron ' s
short - term cash reserves . assets of enron ' s northern natural gas
co . and transwestern pipeline co . will secure the loan .
the financing comes a day after enron said the u . s .
securities and exchange commission is formally investigating
partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . using the
pipelines as collateral signals enron ' s desperation to reassure
shareholders and trading partners that it is creditworthy ,
investors said .
` ` its not reassuring , it ' s worrisome , ' ' said donald coxe ,
manager of the harris insight equity fund , which owns about 78 , 000
enron shares . ` ` if they had to secure the loan , obviously the
lenders don ' t think they can rely on enron ' s financial
statements . ' '
shares of enron fell $ 1 . 35 , or 9 . 7 percent , to $ 12 . 55 in late
morning trading . earlier , they dropped to $ 11 . 47 . before today ,
the shares had fallen 83 percent this year .
enron ' s shares fell 52 percent last month amid an sec inquiry
into partnerships headed by andrew fastow , enron ' s former chief
financial officer , that cost $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost
shareholder equity . a formal sec investigation began yesterday .
` ` it seems until we know more about the sec investigation ,
it ' s going to be a difficult time for the stock , ' ' said tara
gately , an energy analyst at loomis sayles & co . , which sold most
of its enron shares early last year .
pipeline as collateral
enron , based in houston , got its start as a gas - pipeline
company . in the past decade , chairman kenneth lay has transformed
the company into the biggest trader of electricity , natural gas ,
forest products and other commodities . enron accounts for about a
quarter of u . s . power and natural gas trades .
northern natural gas , enron ' s largest pipeline , has
approximately 16 , 500 miles of pipeline from the permian basin in
texas to the great lakes . transwestern pipeline spans about 2 , 500
miles .
since the sec began its inquiry , concerns about shaky
finances have prevented enron from selling commercial paper , or
short - term ious . the financing is to ` ` enhance market and investor
confidence , ' ' enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said
in a statement .
` ` we are moving aggressively to strengthen our balance sheet
and maintain our investment grade credit rating ' ' mcmahon said .
enron can borrow another $ 200 million by bringing other banks
into the loan , spokeswoman karen denne said . ` ` we don ' t have any
plans to do so at this point , ' ' she said .
credit rating
on monday , moody ' s investors service lowered enron ' s long -
term credit rating to ` ` baa 2 ' ' from ` ` baal , ' ' two notches above
junk status . it also placed the company ' s ` ` p - 2 ' ' rating for
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade .
falling below investment grade would trigger early repayment
terms for affiliated companies enron formed to buy its assets such
as power plants . the affiliates plan to repay borrowed money by
selling the assets . enron might have to repay any difference
between what the assets sell for and the underlying debt .
j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of part of its
azurix north america water business to american water works inc .
for $ 148 . 8 million in cash and assumed debt . salomon smith barney
is the investment banking arm of citigroup inc .

indian financial institutions fail to resolve dabhol power issue

( c ) copyright 2001 asia pulse pte ltd .
new delhi , nov 1 asia pulse - financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) have failed to come up with a solution to the long payment dispute with united states energy company enron that has forced the closing of the us $ 2 . 9 billion dabhol power project .
top officials of idbi and icici met officials in the finance and power ministries here today but failed to come up with an "" optimum "" solution .
"" we discussed enron . the discussions are continuing and we are examining various options , "" idbi chairman p p vora told reporters after meeting power secretary a k basu .
he said the fis , which have a total exposure of over rs 62 billion in the project , wanted to come up with a optimum solution but declined to give a time frame for it .
earlier in the day , vora met finance minister yashwant sinha to apprise him about the situation .
fis had decided to come up with a solution by oct 31 for the second phase of the 2 , 184 mw dabhol power company ( dpc ) .
a settlement of the enron imbroglio , being played out since early this year , assumes importance in view of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee ' s forthcoming visit to washington where he is likely to have wide ranging discussions with us president george bush .
enron was the biggest donor to bush ' s presidential electoral campaign .
so far , tata power and bses ltd . were in the fray for buying enron ' s stake in dpc .
although the companies showed reluctance to buy enron ' s stake at the price spelled out by the us power giant , vora said the two companies are still in the fray .

india : sci to inject more funds into greenfield shipping
11 / 01 / 2001
business line ( the hindu )
fin . times info ltd - asia africa intel wire . business line ( the hindu ) copyright ( c ) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd . all rights res ' d
new delhi , oct . 31 after several rounds of discussions and consultations within its board and with the ministry of shipping , the shipping corporation of india ( sci ) has finally decided to pump in $ 13 million as additional investment in greenfield shipping company to part - fund the gap in project cost of $ 55 million for building an lng tanker for transporting gas to dabhol power company .
"" the shipping ministry has given its in - principle approval to sci for investing an extra $ 13 million in greenfield which will be in the form of a loan to the company and not as extra equity . the additional investment by sci would not require clearance from the union cabinet , "" government sources told business line .
though the additional investment of $ 55 million is to be shared equally by the three promoters of greenfield in proportion to their equity holdings , this proposition has gone awry due to the fact that one of the promoters , enron - affiliate atlantic commercial inc with a 20 per cent stake , has clearly said no to putting its share of extra funds .
in fact , atlantic commercial inc . is understood to have expressed a desire to exit from greenfield by selling its equity worth $ 11 million and the swap cost of $ 19 million .
consequently , the extra investment of atlantic commercial inc of $ 11 million is being shared by the other two partners - sci and japan ' s mitsui o . s . k . lines - apart from their own share of the additional cost in proportion to their equity holdings of 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively .
so , sci will put in an additional $ 13 million comprising its share of $ 11 million and $ 2 million of atlantic commercial ' s share . whereas , mol will pump - in an additional $ 42 million including its share of $ 33 million and $ 9 million of atlantic ' s share .
the additional investment by the promoters of greenfield shipping company has become necessary after the bankers to the lng shipping deal led by anz investment bank had suspended disbursement of the last tranche of the project loan of $ 55 million , citing an event of default .
the additional investment made by sci and mol will take the form of a loan to greenfield which would enable the company to take possession of the lng tanker on the scheduled delivery date of november 15 .
greenfield was formed for owning an operating a 137 , 000 cubic metre capacity tanker for transporting lng to enron - promoted dabhol power plant . the tanker is ready for delivery at the yard of mitsubishi , japan .
the promoters are negotiating with oman lng to deploy the lng tanker ' lng laxmi ' till the lng terminal of dabhol goes on stream .

enron and the curse of drexel
commentary : energy trader ' s friends dry up
by david callaway > , cbs . marketwatch . com
last update : 1 : 15 am et nov . 1 , 2001
san francisco ( cbs . mw ) - - it was the master of its universe .
its employees were rich , young and ruthless . it treated its clients and rivals alike , with disdain . its leader counseled business tycoons and political powerbrokers alike . and when the bottom finally fell out , it didn ' t have a friend in the world to save it .
wall street loves a success story . but it loves a success story gone wrong even more . such was the case for drexel burnham lambert , the junk bond empire of the 1980 s , whose spiritual leader michael milken orchestrated one of the greatest financial shell games of all time before it collapsed in a heap of federal investigations , losses and the largest bankruptcy in wall street history .
for enron , the energy trading giant that has seen its shares lose more than two - thirds of their value this month amid questions about its financial transactions and its stability , the similarities are striking .
like drexel , enron set out to change an industry . like drexel , it succeeded , for a while . under the guidance of chairman ken lay , enron evolved from a backwater texas natural - gas pipeline company to become the nation ' s largest energy merchant .
its enrononline business transformed the way energy trading was done and funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions through the company in last two years . the aggressive trading philosophy geared to squeezing a profit at all costs made millionaires of many employees , while those who were not deemed worthy simply vanished from the trading rooms , no questions asked . enron was and is the dark star of the energy industry .
for his part , lay became an international corporate celebrity , advising president bush on his campaign and taking a lead role with vice president dick cheney on the administration ' s controversial energy plan earlier this year .
but enron ' s attempt to extend its dominance into the telecom industry and its secretive financial structure finally got the best of it . the unexplained resignation of its chief executive in august , the ouster of its chief financial officer last week and the company ' s inability to prove its financial health have prompted investors to bail out of enron stock like jackrabbits escaping a brushfire .
now lay & co . are busy trying to raise cash from a skeptical wall street that is starting to admit it never understood the business in the first place ( sound familiar ? ) . takeover speculation gave enron shares a boost wednesday , helping it end a 10 - day losing streak . but it ' s unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a securities and exchange commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers .
for investors , a short - term rally beyond the jump wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares . but at a closing price of $ 13 . 90 , enron shares are more than a texas mile from their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 last december .
for enron itself , it ' s time to put its cards on the table with regulators and wall street . as the drexel saga showed , a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end .",0

us margin highlights
* responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,
us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel
to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at
exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average
$ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel
lower than this year ' s first quarter average .
* high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,
averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel
from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented
values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater
that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record
high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .
* jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the
october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in
correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight
fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of
$ 5 . 75 per barrel .
* margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per
barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the
recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter
months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel
below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the
historical range .
us demand highlights
* apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million
barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four
weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last
year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .
cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder
temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .
* reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94
mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this
time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million
barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high
level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,
particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during
the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter
months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .
* apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level
to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the
demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .
* reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks
ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a
slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is
currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout
the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd
range during the first quarter of 2001 .
us inventory highlights
* primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing
almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels
and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to
23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent
below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the
past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .
* distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of
october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .
despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped
boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .
primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at
their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not
anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting
demand requirements - albeit at a high price .
* jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to
reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had
been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull
from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be
adequate for the winter .
* inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply
from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks
ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a
drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen
because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .

hello everyone .
this memo only applies to the research group on the 19 th floor that use
the colored printer "" taj mahal "" .
vince has requested that i ask each of you to only use the colored printer
"" taj mahal "" for presentations , newsletters , etc . that require at least 90 %
of color . these cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
would be maybe 15 - 20 pages long . this is not cost effective .
if you have something that has color on the first page , but not on the rest
of the presentation , then please just print the first page on the color
printer
and the rest on "" bandit "" or "" wagon "" .
your help will be greatly appreciated !
thanks !

carly fiorina tops fortune ' s list of 50 most powerful women in business for fourth year
10 / 01 / 2001
business wire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire )
new york - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 1 , 2001 - -
lower - profile women topple more well - known names from tech and
internet sector ; ranking includes 14 newcomers
though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business .
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 .
in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april .
in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . ""
fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says .
as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter .
fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon .
while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first .
in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins .
in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou - sze , vice president , hewlett - packard ( hong kong ) ; patricia barbizet , ceo , artemis ( france ) ; eiko kono , president , recruit ( japan ) : belinda stronach , ceo , magna international ( canada ) ; marina berlusconi , vice chairman , fininvest ( italy ) ; christine tsung , president & ceo , china airlines ( taiwan ) . you can read about the other forty at www . fortune . com or in the international editions of fortune .

employees for the past 6 months , developing a comprehensive innovation
acceleration process for use by potentially all enron employees - and we
would really appreciate your input . we have presented the idea to quite a
few people in the company , and some outside of the company ( strategos
institute ) , all of which have really liked the idea and provided key input .
many people have suggested that we run the idea by you .
if you have some time next week , would you mind allowing me to explain our
ideas to you ? i will follow up with a telephone call .

"Subject: managing enron ' s relationships with the universities
jeff ,
i would like to get on your calendar ( together with jeff shankman ) for 15 -
30 minutes
to discuss the results of my visit at the wharton school with tom piazze .
a separate message about this visit will follow .
i would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships
with
different universities . historically , we were rather passive customers of
the academic institutions , trying to hire the best students and limiting our
presence
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions .
we should rethink the way we work with universities . the efforts to get
the best students look more and more like a hand - to - hand combat and often we
are not
very successful . it is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways :
1 . involvement in research projects . for example , we are currently
underwriting two research
projects at stanford university , involving ph . d . students of professor
nicholas bambos
( a top expert on communications networks ) . we shall participate in formulation
of the projects ' objectives and will be given access to the results .
involvement in research projects allows us to obtain
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and
also to lock - up some very
promising students . most companies in the high tech industries have such
programs .
2 . lectures and presentations by enron employees . practically every
presentation
i have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes
and hiring decisions .
it is important that students get exposed to enron early in their academic
program . in many cases ,
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach
them during their
senior years .
3 . visits by faculty members in enron .
closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to
getting the best students
and obtaining access to current research . the universities are very important
in shaping public opinion
on the issues critical to enron ' s future ( especially in the area of
deregulation and design of new markets ) .
currently , the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on
personal commitment of a number
of overworked enron employees . in many cases , there is no continuity and
focus .
i want to recommend a creation of a special function ( vp or md level )
responsible for coordinating
our relationships with the universities . this function would be separate from
our analyst / associate
program . i have many ideas how this function could be structured .

subject : prelminary findings on deals not bridging
i ' ve attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to unify for
november . please don ' t let this alarm you , this is how the bridge has always
worked . if you have questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .
every instance i ' ve found looks okay because of the following :
* a transport ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* the deal was killed
* the deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the
inactive state in unify
* the deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* the deal didn ' t have a point assigned to it , only a zone

aimee :
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the
reason for the error is that the deal , # 97929 has expired . please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it ?
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on .

"Subject: a computer and internet connection for you and your family
as you know , technology is critical to enron ; it drives our success and will
continue to do so in the future . technology has helped enron create new
businesses like enron broadband services and enron net works , and it is
responsible for applications such as enrononline and enroncredit . com . you  , ve
seen what technology can do at work . now we want you and your family to
realize its benefits at home .
with that in mind , we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the
clickathome
program , which will give each employee a computer for use at home . where
technology permits , we will also subsidize an internet connection . with the
click of a mouse , a home computer plus internet access will put a world of
internet knowledge at your family  , s fingertips .
we have just signed an agreement with dell computer corporation to provide
the computer hardware . we wanted to let you know about the program now in
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home
computer or internet connection in the next few months . the scope of
clickathome includes the following :
? basic package : dell desktop computer with a high - speed processor , floppy
disk drive , mouse , speakers , monitor , modem , cd - rom drive and windows 2000
software . employees will have the option to receive a subsidized internet
connection , including broadband , where commercially available .
? participation : this program will be available to active regular full - time
and regular part - time employees of enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries ;
however , employees of some enron companies ( portland general electric , eott ,
enron facility services ) may not be able to participate due to legal ,
accounting , tax , labor or business reasons . eligibility includes being
employed at the time of implementation .
? timing : u . s . employee sign - up will begin in early 2001 , with delivery of
the equipment and internet connection to follow shortly thereafter . delivery
of equipment to participating non - u . s . employees is targeted for late 2001 .
details about this program are still being finalized . to address some of
your initial questions , we  , ve posted a question - and - answer document on
http : / / clickathome . enron . com . we will schedule an espeak session in the near
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions . or , you can
submit your questions and comments to clickathome @ enron . com .
we are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your
family . we believe this program takes communication at enron to a new level
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in
the broadband internet revolution . it is just another reason why we believe
enron is a great place to work .",0

executive summary
? socal . ed mou introduced as bill
? house committee douses emergency energy relief act
mou has its day
sources report that california senator polanco has introduced the legislation today for the mou between the governor and socal edison ( sb 78 xx ) . as reported earlier , sources still believe that there is not sufficient legislative support for this measure to pass . senator polanco ' s political career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his mou sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain support from davis . additionally , the cpuc has added two necessary mou provisions to its next week voting agenda , though support for these issues remains weak on the cpuc board .
house energy relief efforts
the house energy and commerce committee gave up plans to ease california ' s energy woes because republicans and democrats could not settle a long standing debate over price caps in the west . representative waxman admitted a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates , and several delayed mark - up sessions for the bill . barton noted the bill had little chance of aid california considering the time it would take to pass the bill would be longer than the california summer .",0

brad ,
we may consider targeting a wide audience . since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities , our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse . our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $ 31 mm ( plus option fees ) .
i have two primary documents . one is the spec sheet and a general scope . the other is a turbine purchase agreement .
a counterparty can have two options : one is to contact us to provide a bid . there would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case . their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract . for $ 1 mm , they would have a 30 day call on the turbines , during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence . the $ 1 mm buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period .
it may be a nuance , but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine . is this consistent with eol ' s format ?

armed with a target list of purchasers , we can craft the new product pop - up to hit those companies ' systems when they log on , which would give them the following information :

ah - ha !
the turbines idea on eol . i don ' t want to post an advetisement only i want them to post the turbines themselves . so essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product . they have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the abbs we actually have in canada . you never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non - binding as there would be site inspections etc .
but not an advert - actually posting the turbines .

bob shults and i will be attending an enymex reception this thursday , and john and greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with bo and vincent . short answer - - we ' ve got it as covered as possible for now .
another item : i got a call from stephen thome in ena who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on enrononline . jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop - up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets . i ' m told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle , so to speak . i think it fits well for the turbines , but i wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development .

subject : enymex
i recently met robert "" bo "" collins , the new president of the nymex and formerly with el paso . bo is keenly aware that the nymex has fallen down in two areas - - first , catering too much to the locals , while ignoring their true customer base and secondly , not following through with the enymex rollout . bo along with vincent viola , the new chairman of the nymex are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately . personally , i think there is a chance that enrononline could partner with the nymex and it could benefit both . obviously , they need us far more than we need them , but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the nymex management . is this something of interest and if so , should we follow up ? bo and vince will be in houston in late august for a nymex cocktail party at rocc and i could arrange a meeting at enron .",0

subject : ees / ena customer split
tim :
as we discussed , speaking on behalf of trading ( not origination ) our preferred approach to dividing the western region customer base into ees and ena categories would be to "" let the market decide . "" under this approach , ees would be free to contact any customer they wanted as we would . the customers will elect if they want to do a transaction with ees or ena . .
that said , this approach is not meant to be an antagonistic one . we would be focusing on larger accounts ( generators and load ) in excess of 1 mw who want to pre - schedule . we will not be offering a burner - tip solution that includes our having load risk or paying transmission and distribution . if customers want that , we will be forwarding the lead to ees , probably to doug condon . we would expect ees to do the same thing . i have worked with doug condon in the past . once management has blessed this approach , i will call doug and clarify how we want the approach to work . let me know if you find out that he is the "" right "" contact person .
the beauty of this approach is that it is clean . the negative is that customers might be contacted by more than one enron employee . i think that is ok , however , as there are good reasons for that . our two companies offer two distinct approaches . we should be making customers aware of this fact when we explain possible solutions and let them decide what is best for them .
let me know if this approach is ultimately adopted .

subject : controls needed to ensure cashflows are received by infinity
shona , brent and sally ,
this morning , the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by
infinity from the erms system . we normally get 375 books and only got 296
this morning .
per conversation with joyce kuo and mike moscoso , susan trevino , risk
controls , and christian , rac , changed the book heirarchy on friday , moving
global products books , including the prepays , out of the ect group and into
another group . we have had discussions in the past verifying with risk
controls that the ect group is the only group which automatically sends its
cash flows to infinity . other cash flows from books are included only by
being listed in a script . this was not done when the books were moved from
the ect group on friday .
obviously , the rate & currency is not able to hedge enron ' s cash flows when
so much has been omitted . at this time we are about one hour away from a
good hedging report for the trading desk . this report is due the desk daily
by 7 : 30 am .
mike and i discussed the need for controls and sign - off by him or shona for
changes in book heirarchy .

if you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with legato

these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements ,
that would be extremely helpful . we understand that both these

the two licenses are :
1 . enterprise software license agreement between legato
systems , inc . and [ e ] corp , dated as of sept . 27 , 2001 , respecting
numerous software products generally branded with the names
networker , gems , celestra , octopus and others . section 2 . 2
provides : "" restrictions on use . licensee shall not , and shall
not aid , abet or permit any third party to : . . . ( iii ) . . . use
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . .
the software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . . ""
2 . products license agreement # 3185 modified for [ e ]
corp , issued by ration software corp . , dated as of feb . 17 , 1998 ,
respecting various software products branded clearcase , rational ,
purify , and quantify and others . section 1 . 1 provides : "" general
grant of license . . . . you may not rent , lease or use the product
in a service bureau capacity . . . . . ""
we continue to review the agreements for the service
bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective .
we have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring
those to your attention as a group later .
if other express provisions such as the above turn up , i
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our
it personnel are taking seriously .

subject : names of individuals for prc representative and commercial staffing
lead
per our discussion at the executive committee meeting this morning , please
identify 2 representatives for the associate and analyst prc process and 1
individual as commercial staffing lead . the criteria for these individuals
are as follows :
prc representatives
the prc for associates and analysts will be conducted like the vp and md
process . a committee selected by executive committee members will
facilitate the process . the office of the chairman believes that
participation in the associate and analyst prc should be a platform for
exposure to election to the next level in the organization . consequently ,
associate prc representatives should be vice presidents who are on promotion
track to md and analyst representatives should be directors who are on
promotion track to vice president .
commercial staffing leads
we need your assistance to determine accurate hiring targets to ensure that
the talent we attract will be valued and utilized meaningfully . the office
of the chairman is ultimately holding each ceo accountable for working with
the program staffing coordinators to staff the talent and to determine the
hiring goals . the ceo may delegate this responsibility to a highly
respected , interested , senior commercial person . this responsibility should
not be delegated to an hr representative .
please provide the names by end of the day tomorrow , 5 / 9 / 00 . thanks , to
those of you who have responded .

executive summary
? legislators prepare to address socal bailout options
? $ 5 . 7 b revenue notes request in state treasurer ' s hands
bonds & bankruptcy :
the edison mou is expected to be the major issue on the political agenda this week , and the legislative leadership wants to pass some bail - out measure by this friday ( 8 / 24 ) . while analysts are confident that there will be an mou passed , many are skeptical that the current proposals will be able to cobble together 41 votes in the assembly . the davis administration has said proceeds from the november bond sale will be used to repay the $ 6 . 2 b borrowed from general fund to purchase energy . however , repeated delays in the bond sale have caused concern . and pg & e is upset that the money will be first used to pay off the state without offsetting some of the funds the state owes pg & e .
assembly republican leader dave cox has said that his members will not vote for any plan that is not a clean bailout ( i . e . without additional provisions related to environmental mitigation ) . thus , he is essentially saying his members will vote for assembly member rod wright ' s proposal , and no other current plan . but wright ' s proposal does not have much support from democrats . sources report that at least one prominent legislator , senator mike machado , has apparently remarked that he is not certain of the need to pass an mou . others may be muttering similar things , but an mou is still likely .
strangely , though , no discussions were held at the staff level this week on mou legislation . the key driver in the mou debate is how much of a "" haircut "" sce will be required to take ( as a hit to the parent company ) . sources report that sce will accept a haircut of $ 500 m . however , should the haircut be placed in the range of $ 1 b , we are told that sce ' s bryson has informed his team that he would take sce into bankruptcy voluntarily . this represents a significant turnaround in sce ' s previous optimism , which is attributable to legislative indifference to the sce bankruptcy threat as well as growing tension between bryson and governor davis . as for the middle range between $ 500 m and $ 1 b , it is difficult to ascertain how high sce will go before pulling the bankruptcy trigger .
short term - anticipatory notes
state controller kathleen connell has asked for an emergency sale of a $ 5 . 7 b short term note ( possibly in the form of a revenue anticipation note / ran ) to cover california ' s electricity costs until november , when $ 12 . 4 b in state bonds are expected to be issue by the legislature . the state controller ' s request was made because of her legal obligation to issue a demand to the treasurer at any time she determines that the general fund has or will have insufficient funds for the payment of all appropriations by the legislature . connell claims the ran , which could be offered as early as september , is necessary because the state ' s general fund is running dry from recent power purchases .
state treasurer angelides is studying the plan , but has yet to publicly comment . according to sources , he has also yet to comment to legislators , but was in new york last week meeting with people on wall street about the bond issuance . mandated by state statute , angelides can issue these notes unilaterally and does not need approval from the legislature or anyone else . he has total discretion on the issuance , its timing , and its amount . however , the state ' s general fund would not be depleted by november 15 th , even without the ran revenue . rans are not that unusual . rans were previously issued from fy 95 - 96 through fy 99 - 00 with the largest being the $ 5 b ran in fy 92 - 93 . because of california ' s recent economic growth , rans were not necessary last year and were expected to be unnecessary this year .
concerns surrounding the pg & e suit filed earlier last week ( pg & e seeks priority in the $ 12 b revenue bond allocations ) are somewhat eased by a well - placed utility source who report that the suit will have little impact the revenue bond or anticipatory notes ' issuance . however , there is suspicion among some that the administration is increasingly concerned that investor confidence is weakening and that the bond issuance might be deemed a failure , and is thus promoting the idea that pg & e ' s actions are responsible , rather than investor uncertainty over revenue stream allocation and dwr contracts . in the event that the revenue bonds ' issuance is delayed past the october 31 st bridge loan maturity , the interest rate charged to the state would reportedly jump from four percent to seven percent .",0

parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in
his closet !
does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .
and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods -
new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old
sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties ,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .
"" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old
woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my
husband earns in a year "" .
the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet .
as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of
"" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday
after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom .
"" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name
on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever
15 - year - old .
the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list .
the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and
really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .
within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box
that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .
"" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a
yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i
was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over
the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the
money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties ,
fifties and hundreds .
"" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next
bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid . the reporting news
team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was
completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 ,
section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in
the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .
every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read ,
"" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a
five - dollar fee .
[ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .
be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you
say "" bull "" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the
internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really
can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are
"" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" .
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this
program has attained , it is currently working better
than ever .
note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when
i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions .
in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the
following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money
for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible .
this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was
approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total
$ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in "" .
pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .
here is another testimonial : "" this program has been around for a long time
but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the
mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions
and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i
only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of
$ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i
have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change
anything . "" more testimonials later but first ,

how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been
tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their
friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money .
but it does not work this way . believe us , we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than
what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember ,
honesty reaps the reward ! ! !

your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going :
method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally
let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will
assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .
continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails .
with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10
people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 .
out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that equals
100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .
those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails .
the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .
those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million
e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .
those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of
50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000
orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times
$ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half million ) . your total income in this example is :
1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . .
grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00
numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out
the worst possible responses and no matter how you
calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !
remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people
ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people

subject : re : real time var
ziyong ,
we met with nilay and winston last week regarding real time var calculation
possibility .
winston has an overview of var system which consists of :
- main curves simulation ;
- curve server ;
- book server ;
- id server
- clients
as a first step i want to see where the time is spent when var runs , which
percentages of time are spent by each part .
nilay is going to get this information for a few portfolios ( agg - ect , agg - gas
and ng - price - prc ) .
preliminary information : currently var run takes about 1 hour , half of this
time taken by "" book server ""
( we have about 4500 lower level portfolios in the portfolio hierarchy , about
5500 portfolios all together ) ,
most of the rest is taken by "" clients "" , "" main curves simulation "" does not
take much time .
i am looking also at using alternative methods of faster var calculation , but
having so many portfolios in the hierarchy will slow down
even analytical var .
we also have to think more about what "" real time "" calculation means and what
it should produce .

"Subject: meeting with mr . sud
rebecca ,
as we had spoken on the phone , i met with mr . kk sud , a retired secretary in
the govt . of india yesterday . this meeting was arranged at vince ' s request ,
since vince had been approached by mr . sud ' s son who is a student at rice
( where vince teaches a course ) . the younger mr . sud had wanted someone at
enron to meet with his father who was visiting houston , and is currently an
advisor ( post retirement from the government ) to the prime minister ' s office .
this was my first meeting , and i have no background check on the person .
however , the meeting was interesting , and mr . sud conveyed to me in
confidence that the indian govt . is very interested in solving the dabhol
issue . he also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction of
ntpc buying all the power from dabhol , but that this was still under wraps .
i have no way of judging the genuineness of this person , but he claimed to
have been secretary in the ministry of defence for some 16 years , which is a
very important post in india . the information he was conveying seemed so
important that vince and i decided to update you on the same by phone this
morning .
mr . sud is leaving houston on monday so , as discussed , i will see if he can
meet with you on saturday morning .

"Subject: caiso notification : revised draft iso charge matrix and statement
file specification ( vl 3 . 2 ) - ferc order implementation - to be effective
trade date june 21 , 2001
sc settlement contacts :
important notice
revised iso charge matrix and
* emissions and
* mcp for real time incremental energy .
the adder raises the mcps , but does not affect the underlying settlement
formulation . the only change made to the settlement files is the inclusion
of a new data field for the unadjusted mcp .
emissions and start - up cost recovery
the ferc order also directed iso to exclude emissions and start - up fuel
costs from the calculation of iso ' s mitigated market clearing prices .
generators can invoice iso for such costs incurred as a direct result of iso
dispatch actions . iso will implement two new charges :
* charge type 591 - emissions cost recovery ; and
* charge type 592 - start - up cost recovery .
these new charges serve as a mechanism for iso to collect funds which will
be kept in trust accounts to pay the generators ' invoices . a rate will be
established by iso for each charge . for emissions cost recovery , the rate
will equal that of the forecasted annual total of all emission costs ,
incurred by must - offer generators as a direct result of iso dispatch
instructions , adjusted for interest as may accrue in the emissions cost
trust account , divided by the sum of the forecasted in - state load served by
the iso ' s transmission system . for start - up cost recovery , the rate will be
determined similarly . it will equal that of the forecasted annual total of
all start - up costs , incurred by must - offer generators as a direct result of
iso dispatch instructions , adjusted for interest as may accrue in the
start - up cost trust account , divided by the sum of the forecasted in - state
load served by the iso ' s transmission system . iso plans to publish these
rates shortly . the rates may be adjusted monthly based on iso ' s latest
forecast .
both charges will appear as monthly lump sums in the scheduling
coordinator ' s settlement statement for the last day of the trade month .
detail breakdown of the charges incurred by the scheduling coordinator on a
given day will be provided in the statement for that day .
implementation timeline
the credit risk adder and the new emission & start - up cost recovery scheme
went into effect on trade date 6 / 21 / 2001 . the statements for 6 / 21 will be
issued on 8 / 15 / 2001 .
comments & questions
attached for your review are drafts of the revised charge matrix and
statement files specification ( version 13 . 2 ) .
questions and comments related to the attached documents can be directed to
mr . c . p . ng via email ( cng @ caiso . com ) . iso plans to finalize the
specification by 8 / 6 / 2001 .

subject : metals - imminent actions - an update
rick / rick / sally
i attach the ' executive ' summary of a note sent to the office of the chair
last week detailing current operational difficulties with the metals
merchanting business . subsequently an ' all hands ' meeting was called to
discuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of
off balance sheet facility ( "" obsf "" ) renegotiation
minimising working captial
sap implementation
the notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email
should you require any further information please call , otherwise i will
forward updates as they are completed .
regards
mike
issue
the physical metals business implemented an off balance sheet structure
( obsf ) pre year - end to meet enron requirements for gearing ratios .
whilst this does not present undue problems for lme warrants , these being
bearer documents , it does present an issue when physical metal , the value of
which depends upon brand and location , is placed into the facility . given the
hard deadline of year - end the operational support of this process initially
took place on spreadsheets .
the impact of the obsf on the operational side of the physical business
should not be underestimated . the process of moving material off and on
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements ,
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in
the as 400 . with the specified functionality it is believed that all
operational and trading issues arising from obsf can be managed
satisfactorily .
the core functionality , which was due prior to the year - end , was released
during january but was subsequently found to have introduced  + bugs  , to the
integrated business control processes . whilst an improvement on having no
obsf functionality , the  + bugs  , have had an increasingly negative effect on
the control environment , compounded by the fact that it can not provide a
guaranteed delivery for the  + bug  , fixes and non core  , reporting  ,
functionality .
this has given rise to the following concerns :
? there are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a
brand & location level to coordination records ( the global position is
reconciled however ) .
? it is not possible to substantiate the dpr for em & cl as :
? a ) p & l on spread moves from cash to 3 months positions ( and related cash to
3 months provisions ) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated ,
and
? b ) system bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values .
these concerns are compounded by the following :
? the most experienced as 400 it developer for the em & cl business has
resigned . he is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in
july 2001 .
? the most experienced as 400 it developer on the eml side of the business has
also resigned . he left in january 2001 .
? there is no documentation for the as 400 . it is therefore difficult for
experienced as 400 programmers to get upto speed on the system .
conclusion
it is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the
as 400 system and the renegotiation of the obsf facility with barclays . the
current situation has arisen due to non - delivery of it developments and tight
timescales on the finalisation of the obsf facility .
to meet ql end requirements ( i . e . full production of the dpr and stock
reconciliation ) , it and the obsf deal team must make concrete commitments on
delivery timeline . the business will not be able to commit to successful
implementation of the facility and resubstantiation of the trial balance
without these

hi vince , i talked to tom gros today and metioned our desire to estabilish a
strategic relationship with nick bambos and his research effort . tom is very
excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check . i suggested that we
have more of a strategic relationship in mine ( enron / stanford ) and he
agreed to that as well . tom mentioned that greg whalley was interested in
estabilishing such a relationship . vince , could you follow this up and
ground this ? if you need any help in doing the leg work , i ' ll happy to do
that .
tom is excited about ebs research ' s role to support all of ebs including
bandwidth trading . he seems very interested in being our sponsor on the ebs
side . that would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior
management decision through kevin hannon . vince , i would suggest that you
try to setup a meeting with kevin hannon and tom to discuss this further .
tom is also very interested in the new product development effort that larry
and i have been kicking around for some time . he wanted us to sit back and
think of structured products with better margins that blend & extend that
they are selling . he wanted to know now much more resource that we need in
that front . for this , i would like to get someone like meera natarajan . she
is an originator currently working in ees and have talked to zimin and

"Subject: preliminary cost savings for ea
from our work weekend before last , our third scenario ( staying in the business , but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels ) , our estimated savings for operations and it development were :
annualized savings ( in millions ) & headcount reductions ( enron employees )
direct costs bonus subtotal net cap total
ops it accural savings severance savings ex savings
5 . 4 12 . 8 1 . 5 19 . 7 3 . 8 15 . 9 11 . 8 27 . 7 dollar savings
65 71 - 136 fte reduction
this work was not done at the level of identifying individuals , but rather positions . identify indiour work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals ' names . we have already identified our lower performers across operations and it as well . we had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting eim and egm who could potentially support ea and ees in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units .
the above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from jenny rub , which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued ( i . e . server savings ) . the estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the eol charges for ea that may result from cost reductions that greg piper is having with brad richter .
your desire to cut costs for ea but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible . we will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you .

"Subject: re : alex ' s paper
comments :
1 . in the sentence between eqn . 3 and eqn . 4 , i think "" annualized
volatility "" should replace "" annualized standard deviation . ""
2 . as to the comment , "" immediately we see something quite
counter - intuitive . "" i would disagree . i think that its quite intuitive
that this model should get closer to the black - scholes price as what is
defined as the "" jump "" component becomes just part of the main price
distribution , which happens if we define a jump to be only a 1 - sigma
event . the table does show , however , that the results of using this model
are very sensitive to exactly how you choose to define a "" jump "" ( i . e . 2 - sigma
or 3 - sigma . . . events ) , and this is one difficulty in using the model in
practice .
3 . in the paragraph after the table , i don ' t understand the argument about
hedging the option . especially about buying a swap which would pay on the
difference between the strike and fs . this seems non - sensical .
4 . i could not follow the logic of the last two sentences of the article , so
this point should probably be explained more clearly .

dear vince :
it was so nice meeting and talking with you too . i did
not take any pen back , i lost my pen too somewhere in
enron .
as i mentioned to you , after i got my ph . d in 1999 , i
have been working two years as lead scientist and
science manager in energy division at pros revenue
management inc . in houston .
i developed and implemented the mathematical models
for trading optimization system and firm
transportation optimization system .
the trading optimization system becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year . duke energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday . conoco and williams also signed the
contracts for it . according to pros sales department ,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years .
enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management . i am
confident that i can make significant contributions to
enron in this area .
i would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to enron for this interview . i am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
enron .
sincerely yours

hey penny
need your help urgently to pull together a short one or two pager for
us to present to the business first thing tomorrow . the one urgent
issue that has not yet been resolved in regards to migration of enron
systems is the domain name and how we direct traffic to the site . jim
has registered the domain names below , in the absence of any direction
from the business .
to give a bit of context , the site will contain power & gas trading and
third party feeds . it will not have any intermingled content with the
rest of client portal . it will have its own electronic client
contracts and disclaimers . it will have a distinct team responsible
for allocating client passwords , assigning entitlements , ehelp , etc .
so in summary the whole site will be run and managed completely
separately from rest of corp kiss , judit

after six years , profit from company ' s power operations remains years
away

nowa sarzyna , poland - - from a small power plant humming among the
birches near the ukrainian border , enron corp . has staked its claim on
the polish energy market .
yet after six years , the company is still seeking a mother lode .
the houston - based energy producer and trader entered poland in 1994 ,
nabbed one of the first power - trading licenses to go to a foreign
company and began work on elektrocieplownie nowa sarzyna , poland ' s first
new , foreign - operated heat - and - power plant .
other companies followed , including electricite de france , rwe ag of
germany , vattenfall ab of sweden and tractebel sa of belgium .
the prize could be a rich one . all of these companies hope to profit
as poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining
the european union .
a wholesale power bourse is due to open in warsaw in july . and the
country ' s transmission links to markets east and west could make poland
the power - trading hub of central europe .
but after six years in poland , enron has yet to earn a profit . net
income from nowa sarzyna , which is to begin commercial production later
this month , is at least five years away . power - trading operations might
generate profits next year , if the new bourse gets moving . but that is
"" one big question mark , "" says jarek astramowicz , enron poland ' s
president .
indeed , despite its promise , poland ' s energy sector remains a
sizzling tangle of aging plants , archaic market agreements and complex ,
shifting regulations .
enron , with $ 40 billion ( 41 . 69 billion euros ) in annual revenue , is
an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers . but in a power
market as negatively charged as poland ' s , the company also is an example
of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors
offline .
"" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear
some risks , "" says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at
the world bank in warsaw . "" but eventually they have to generate some
return . ""
enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it
entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . ' s energy sector
liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord
pool ' s largest - volume trader .
enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits
for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .
just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its
1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795
million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s .
yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company
declines to compare development times in various countries .
"" i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , ""
says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron
europe in london . "" but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past ,
it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process
and get to the starting point . ""
at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach
the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,
and the polish power industry ' s rules .
the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he
burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and
the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur
before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna
to enron in 1998 .
enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,
gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the
plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired
behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to
the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a
20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam
output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat
the town of nowa sarzyna .
the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank
loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts .
"" they were betting on their good name , "" says michael davies , a
partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron
poland ' s lenders . "" they are pushing envelopes all the time . ""
that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an
energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 .
says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon
smith barney in london : "" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .
( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . ""
mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by
renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna
"" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name
on it . ""
in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset
privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by
2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of
power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a
12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .
the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion
euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .
"" the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really
know the price of electricity , "" says bengt wegemo , president of
vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for
55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340
million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10
years .
investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .
ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will
trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the
polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord
pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .
but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be
amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to
poland ' s distribution network .
further , the government says it must solve the competition problem
posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which
account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used
the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when
prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete
with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize .
the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the
modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a
private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice
what outmoded plants charge .
"" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will
generate us a ( bigger ) profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .
another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory
legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also
known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with
electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission
service .
pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s
vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding
signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export
electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .
"" this is great news , "" mr . astramowicz says . "" if this joint venture
gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would
expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . ""
enron and others are pushing hard for that access . "" as soon as the
market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a
decent profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .

vince / kim :
i am flying to houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming tuesday sometime for 1 / 2 hour or
so . i really want to reinitiate the conversations marketpoint was having
with john goodpasture and you , and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite
positive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through
license ,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you .
would this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ?
if
so , please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 . i think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run narg
and the long run narg in which you were interested ( not to mention our
power
model ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short
term narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from venezuelan lng , north american lng import terminals and
term , gas basis calculations , trading support , power plant development ,
gas - to - power price spreads in key markets , veracity of heat rate trades ,
bank financings , storage field evaluation , and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs .
i really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again . i think narg can help you become even more
successful , and i look forward to working with you .
we have a new office address and new phone number as well . ( we move in may

"Subject: re : backtesting for different percentiles
vlady , i enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots ( you saw them before ) .
the following table shows what was the percentage of the days when pnl fell
below var 95 , var 90 , var 85 .
these results are based on the real ng forward prices from 1 / 1 / 99 to 6 / 7 / 00
for 2 different portfolios :
- portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to ng - price - prc portfolio
positions on 6 / 6 / 00 ,
- portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to storage - prc positions on
5 / 25 / 00 .
portfolio 1
var 95 var 90 var 85
implied vols 2 . 93 4 . 11 5 . 57
historical vols with decay = 1 7 . 62 12 . 02 15 . 54
historical vols withdecay = 0 . 97 6 . 75 12 . 02 15 . 54
historical vols withdecay = 0 . 94 6 . 45 12 . 02 15 . 54
portfolio 2
var 95 var 90 var 85
implied vols 4 . 1 6 . 74 9 . 97
historical vols with decay = 1 7 . 04 11 . 14 15 . 84
historical vols withdecay = 0 . 97 6 . 74 10 . 56 16 . 13
historical vols withdecay = 0 . 94 7 . 04 11 . 14 15 . 84
this shows that when we have more observations ( columns corresponding to
var 90 and var 85 )
compared to the column corresponding to var 95 the frequency of curve shift
being lower than var
becomes closer to the theoretical value ( 5 % , 10 % and 15 % ) . the numbers in the
column "" var 85 "" are
very close to 15 % . this is the argument in favor of using historical vols .
and also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment .
also notice : the numbers in column "" var 95 "" are higher than 5 % and this is an
indication of fat tails .
let me know if you have any questions .

"Subject: cal . update 7 / 30 / 01 - direct access
executive summary
direct access could make a rescue of socal edison more difficult
bond issuances for california may be in jeopardy as direct access becomes more popular with municipalities
municipal power is politically attractive
there is growing pressure across california for cities to consider forming their own municipal power companies . community leaders across the state are enviously eyeing the success of sacramento ' s smud utility and the los angeles municipal power utility , where rate hikes and service disruptions have been far less pronounced than the rest of the state . several leaders in san francisco are considering setting up their own power company , and another two dozen cities are also contemplating action . municipal power companies are not subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission , and could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes .
trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult , as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long - standing privileges in california politics . under california law , it is very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best interest . most older and larger cities are "" charter cities "" rather than "" general law cities "" subject to the california municipal code . under the california constitution , charter cities can pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army . the league of california cities - a weighty organization representing every one of california ' s cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access . most assembly democrats started out as city councilors and have some sympathy with local independence . and the resistance within the assembly is already building against hertzberg ' s attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access .
some city leaders will not wish to fight the governor and the state legislature on the issue . but if municipalities do not opt out , they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company . cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers . politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter , and this could affect campaign contributions .
state power plans at risk
if municipalities do move to set up their own power companies , it could undermine at least three key elements of the state of california ' s power plans :
first , the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users . but municipal power would unpick this structure , allow large regions of california to ignore the puc , leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city . many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes . others might cave into irate voters .
second , the plans laid out by governor davis ' and state treasurer angelides ' for a california state public power authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it . it is possible that long - term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long - term rates by buying on the open market . it could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss .
third , revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled , if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond . and if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state , it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments .
the issue is at an early stage - - the puc had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in san francisco on friday . state legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession , or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away . but stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult .",0

subject : bridge problems
over the last 8 - 10 business days , we have had a some issues on the bridges . i
want to educate you a little bit on what can cause
"" bridge problems "" .
first , what i want to explain is their is one gui bridge application for
users ( backoffice users ) to monitor the bridge but there are multiple
systems that enrononline transactions can be pointed to downstream . this is
important to understand because if you do not know this ,
it may seem like we are having the same problem over ie "" the bridge
is having problems "" . but in actuality , it is different
problems . still not good - but at least it cannot be isolated to one
problem .
also , due to multiple systems ( sitara , enpower , gasdesk , tagg / erms ,
powerdesk ) are listening for messages from one enrononline ,
a "" bridge "" problem could be one of many issues . some of which are :
the server for enrononline messenger goes down ( doesn ' t send message to
bridge to process )
the enron network goes down ( cannot send message thru bridge )
the nfs server ( enron main server ) goes down
sitara server goes down
enpower server goes down
tagg / erms server goes down
deal worker in any system gets "" hung up ""
huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems
scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re - started on
sunday
and the list goes on . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
fyi in the past week & 1 / 2 , the following actions happened , which caused
"" bridge "" problems .
scheduled outage for maintenance on tagg / erms server on weekend was not
re - started on sunday ( not smart )
the nfs server ( enron main server ) goes down ( affected sitara & tagg / erms )
deal worker in sitara system got "" hung up "" and servers had to be bounced
member of enrononline dev team changed data for specific tokenised periods
during trading hours instead of end of day
( this failed deals in bridge for sitara & tagg / erms )
one thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office .
traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their
position manager application of their system . if they are gas traders , if
could be sitara or tagg system . if they are a power trader
calling , they cannot see it in enpower . ecetera , ecetera
if a back office person calls , they are watching the monitor gui and they can
see deals queing / backing up and know there is a problem .
we are working to resolve some of these issues , particularily ,
multi - processing tools , as we know the # of transactions will only increase .
please feel free to email me if you have any questions . i hope this was
helpful .
see below for explanation of problem on wednesday .

subject : sitara production problem
i am forwarding a message that explains the sitara production problems from
this morning . please let me know if you have any additional questions .
karie ( 36759 )
at 9 : 50 am this morning a dealworker process in the sitara system became
unresponsive .
at 10 : 00 am it was determined that the eolbridge in sitara was not
processing new deal requests
and diagnostics lead to an indication that the dealworker was not functioning
properly .
at 10 : 14 , am the dealworker was forced down and a new one restarted .
at 10 : 21 am , the eolbridge began processing deals .
the cause of the is difficult to determine , but indicators point to an error
in the corba product we are using ,
most likely due to scalability issues of that product and of sitara . this is
an issue that is actively being addressed .

"Subject: re : fw : tax reserve on allegheny peakers
i just spoke with matthew and he explained that the transaction tax reserve calculation ( a summary of which is attached ) was prepared ( and communicated to the deal group ) early last fall . the calculation indicates that the aggregate transaction tax exposure ( including penalties ) is $ 12 , 940 , 182 . the initial suggested tax reserve related to this exposure was approximately 1 / 2 of this amount but , after discussions with don last week , was increased to 100 percent - thus the increase in tax reserve of approximately $ 6 , 000 , 000 . thus , as evident , it is not that a calculation was incorrect but that its assessment probability was increased and thus the suggested tax reserve changed . matthew was influenced in increasing the applicable level of risk related to the transaction by a desire to more conservatively posture enron after the completion of the disposition and to insure that subsequent period "" surprises "" did not occur - obviously , to the extent that collective management is of the belief that such a conservative posture is not appropriate then the tax reserve amount may be reduced . matthew spoke with don before the change was proposed and was under the impression that all were comfortable with the change before it was made - ultimately , we will realize the reserved amount in earnings as the risk of the tax planning strategies subsides . matthew will be back in the office on may 8 and ready to speak with whomever desires at that time . i am attending the enron law conference beginning this afternoon , followed by the enron industrial markets offsite next monday and tuesday but can be reached on my cell phone at 713 - 817 - 5052 . best regards . steve .

this is a substantial difference which was not requested when the deal was done . i am waiting for matthew to return and explain why his opinion changed . i am more concerned that we are making such a change having got it wrong to start with rather than the change itself .

subject : fw : tax reserve on allegheny peakers
wes , attached is the explanation for the allegheny tax reserve . i do not know why it was increased when it was . it was my understanding that the reserve had been quantified by matt gockerman in my group and requested some time ago and that don and the commercial leads were aware of this . this may be coming across as an increase when in reality it is simply properly booking currently that which was previously expected ( said differently , without the disposition we would have spread the tax over time and with the disposition it became necessary to accelerate it as reflected in the tax reserve ) . as always , i have asked that only the absolutely necessary amount be reserved . please call me at ext . 30938 to further discuss this matter . best regards . steve .

subject : re : tax reserve on allegheny peakers
the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax ( "" sales / use tax "" ) liability related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of various equipment ( i . e . , turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee and indiana ) used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois , indiana and tennessee . enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pursuant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny ( effectively , this tax liability is a "" pre - acquisition date "" tax liability that we , as the seller , are responsible for ) . typically , the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed sales / use tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny . the ews tax department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sales / use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time ( for example , a sales - leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sales / use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ) . ultimately , we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have ( and we believe did in the specific case of allegheny ) modelled the cost of the peakers as including the full current payment of such sales / use tax . that said , we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and , if challenged , there is a risk that we would not prevail . matt is out until may 8 ( he is a recent father of a baby girl ) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like . matt has worked closely with don and others in the generation asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound ( not overly conservative nor liberal ) position . best regards . steve .

subject : quick update on el paso capacity allocation conference
today ' s technical conference ( rpo 0 - 336 ) was not the snazzy show we perhaps expected . with el paso having done 5 studies on different allocation scenarios , shippers requested four more , showing seasonalization impacts and the difference between cd and full requirements shipper coincidental and non coincidental peaks .
though there were some fr vs . cd shippers discussions , they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by
the tx , nm and az fr shippers and aera energy ( cd shippers ) . there was also no mention of converting fr shippers to cd service .
the primary issue here ended up being procedural , with the decision still up in the air if this should be set for hearing or a merits decision from the commission ( or settlement , though that seems very likely - - merits decision is the most likely case ) .
also never mentioned were the cd and fr complainants proposals that el paso dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or requiring mainline system expansion for existing service ( rpol - 484 and 486 ) .
the procedural schedule has been set :
el paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing : sept . 24
initial comments ( on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations ) : oct . 15
reply comments : oct . 26
i ' ll send a more detailed report , but wanted to get the quick info . out to those most interested .",0

"Subject: p & l
tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this .

"Subject: quick note
louise :
i just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e - mail . it seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation .
basically all i want to tell you is that i ' m here to help in this process , and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular i can help on . i have spoken and offered the same directly to miller , calger and duran . i ' m not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow . as i think you know , the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term , and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen ( as evidenced by the $ 1 . 375 million doyle insurance settlement finalized today ) .
i ' m approaching you and others specifically because i have 2 years of chapter 11 bankruptcy experience . prior to me joining enron in may of 1998 , i was with kenetech corporation ( a 1 , 200 employee publicly traded ipp ) . in 1996 ( after having worked as an originator at kenetech since 1990 ) , kenetech filed for chapter 11 . as part of the chapter 11 process , i was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the company to be responsible for liquidating the company ' s assets . as such , i am very familiar with the chapter 11 process , and how deals get done in this context . enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude , but i believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable .
again , as we go through this process , i just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area , and let you know that i stand ready , willing and eager to take on additional tasks .
with respect to our current deal flow , i also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which i will get to you by friday ( or earlier if need be ) :
1 . transaction list , status , and valuation ;
2 . site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy ;
3 . projected site bank maintenance budget .
i will , of course , also provide this information to miller , calger and duran .

demonstrate how to value a full - requirements contract to service that
particular load . to do this we will need one or more years of hourly
consumption data , and the general location of the load . ideal data formats
are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns ( date , hrl , hr 2 . . ) or 8760 rows
x 3 columns ( date , hr , load ) . in lieu of using your data , we will provide
sample load data .

"Subject: short term private firm model : static historical
snapshot + performance data for model development
mike , scott , eric ,
after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our
final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows :
we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts
with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following
the latest snapshot . monthly performance indicator need to be available for
the entire 12 months performance period . we will need all the bankrupt and
default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights .
for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs
covering 16 months of performance . this means that we will need rolling ( 4
quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts :
input snapshots performance
1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12
month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000
1999 feb end , 1999 may end , 1999 august end , 1999 november end 12 month
end performance for dec 1999 through nov 2000
1999 jan end , 1999 apr end , 1999 july end , 1999 october end 12 month end
performance for nov 1999 through oct 2000
1998 december end , 1999 mar end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end 12
month end performance for oct 1999 through sep 2000
we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the
performance period . our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90 +
days delinquency on any trade credit .
we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big
picture , it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for
analysis .
please let me know your thoughts . this will require d & b to give us a
modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly .

aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas
( mogi ) again this morning ! montana oi | and gas inc . ( mogi - news )
announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is stil | awaiting a
rig at this time . the surface | ease has been constructed and we have
been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest .
the company has a 25 % working interest in the sylvan lake project .
symbol - mogi
price - $ . 43
reasons to conside mogi :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves potentiaily worth multi - miliions , mogi is selling for | ess
than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets .
4 . montana oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . already
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | |
market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors
for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers like montana oil ( mogi ) that the biggest gains
are being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple
and even quadrupie returns .
vancouver , british coiumbia , march 30 , 2 oo 5 ( primezone ) - - montana oil
and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is please to
announce the following update on its sylvan lake project .
after severa | delays due to unseasonabie weather and road ciosures in
the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto
| ocation
over the weekend and ensign dri | | ing has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m we | |
a
nd are currentiy driiling at 1 , 25 o feet . surface casing wil | be run to
930 feet . the drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated
to dri | | to lo , 00 o feet in depth . drilling operations are expected to
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage . this is an annual
event ,
which occurs in most of central and northern canada when the frost ,
which
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground . drilling operations
for
a | arge rig such as the sylvan lake wel | requires service by heavy
vehicies
such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which wiil be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes ,
§ the road bans that have been taking piace ail over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise , a | | oi | and gas companies are
effected by
breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which wi | |
remain there until we are finished dri | | ing , surface casing has been
compieted and we wiil be ready to finish driliing the minute the road
bans are | ifted .
the syivan lake prospect is a we | | defined 3 - d seismic structural high
within a preserved pekisko remnant isiand that may have virgin
reservoirs
with simiiar production potentia | as the adjacent n poo | where 6 wells
have
produced 680 , oo 0 barrels oi | since 1997 . in overall , the syivan fieid
has
produced 4 o mi | | ion barreis of oi | from the pekisko formation and 50
bi | | ion
cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation .
ensign dri | | ing wil | test a tota | of 3 o feet from severa | zones in the
shunda
formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oi | formation at 7 , 320
feet .
when driiling resumes , the hoie is pianned to reach a tota | depth of
7 , 570 feet ,
which may take some lo days to then complete drilling and testing .
each deveiopment weil has probabie production of 150 barrels of oil per
day
and 750 ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
biilion
cubic feet gas and 30 o , ooo barreis of oi | . there are four other pay
zones that
are prospective for gas . the average we | | in the sylvan lake field has
produced
500 barreis of oi | per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas
per day .
if successful , the company intends to dril | up to 4 more welis on these
land
sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and
natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas
gathering and
processing faciiities and oil transportation faciiities have been
constructed .

"Subject: fw : the odds are against them
there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

clayton -
sorry it took so long to get back to you . there are a couple of things to
keep in mind :
- enron it supports enron equipment .
- all equipment must be purchased through "" enron it purchasing ""
our current high end desktop is a 800 mhz pentium iii machine with 128 m of
ram . you can bump up the ram to whatever you feel is appropriate . when the lghz processors come out ( in the very near future ) that will become our
standard .
what we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for .
the "" image "" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when
it is deployed . if you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image
for , we can ' t support it for a multitude of reasons .
hopefully this answered your questions / concerns .
if not , please call me so that we can discuss this further .
thanks

i have developed a model for enron that requires ultra - high - end pc
performance ( it does many calculations in excel ) , and my boss has authorized
me to buy whatever pc i need . i ' m looking at the compaq 850 , but richard ( our
floor rep ) says no pc ' s over the 600 series will be supported by it . i need
to resolve this issue ; we are sophisticated buyers , we know the type of
machine we want , and we have the money to pay for it .

gooday ,
with warm heart my friend , i send you my greetings , and i hope this letter meets you in good time .
it will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally . however , i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction , which i propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity . i have kept it to myself for a long time , and now i need to act , as time is not on my side . i want you to open - heartedly read through and give me your most needed support . i got your address from an internet directory , in my search for a contact . i apologize if this is not acceptable to you . the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance .
my name is donald phiri , the farm supervisor and personal assistant to mr . david stevens , a very popular and rich farmer from macheke , zimbabwe . my master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of april 2001 , due to the land dispute and political situation in my country , as a result of my master ' s financial support for the mdc ( movement for democratic change ) , the main opposition party to president mugabe ' s party , zimbabwe african national union patriotic front ( zanu - pf ) . for more information on my master ' s murder , you may check the amnesty international country report on zimbabwe for the year 2001 .
when the pressure on white farmers started in zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by president mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers , my master forsaw the danger ahead , he then closed his major bank accounts , and together , we went to johannesburg , south africa to deposit the sum of $ 14 . 5 million ( fourten million , five hundred thousand usdollars ) , in a private security company , for safety . this money was deposited in a box in my name , as my master was being secretive with his name , as the south african government of thambo mbeki is in support of president mugabe ' s actions . the box is labeled as gemstones . my master had planned to use this money for the purchase of lands , new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in botswana . he has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from europe . my master is divorced , and his wife valerie , and only child , diana have relocated to bradford , !
en !
gland for 9 years now .
i am currently in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum . i have now decided to transfer my master ' s money into an account for security and safety reasons . this is why i am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left . you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you .
if you accept to assist me , all i want you to do for me , is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the netherlands , and then we will transfer the money into an account . you may open a new account for this purpose . i have applied to the security company to transfer the box from south africa to their branch here , which they have done .
to legally process the claim of the box , i will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative , and deliver the box to you . i have with me , the certificate used to deposit the box , which we will need for claiming the box .
for valuable assistance , i am offering you 10 % ( $ 1 , 450 , 000 ) of the total money . i have also set aside 1 % ( $ 145 , 000 ) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction , and 4 % ( $ 580 , 000 ) , will be given to charity in my master ' s name i will give 25 % ( $ 3 , 625 , 000 ) to valerie and diana , after my share of the money has been transfered back to me . when they grant my asylum application , my share of the money ( 85 % ) , will be transfered back to me , into an account i will solely own . i also intend to start up a business then . if you have knowledge of farming business in your country , or other areas of possible business investment that i may be interested in , please inform me , so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being .
please , i want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction .
i look forward to your reply and co - operation , and i am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you .
yours sincerely ,
donald phiri .

we consistently have to work on the lack of response issue . some of that is dealt with through walking around and poking around . we just have to be vigilant in ferreting out information . additionally , approval can be received via e - mail , phone or in - person from business unit head or commercial group head . our goal will be to do everything possible to make sure an article appears rather than holding it for future release .
as for the eeos / ena or cross group issue , that is addressed in # 4 below . please advise .

my recommendation for an approval process for entouch is as follows :
1 ) the deadline to provide information for that week ' s issue of entouch will be wednesday at 12 : 00 pm . all information submitted after that time will be held until the following week .
2 ) a draft of entouch will be forwarded to each business unit head ( or their designee ) and commercial group head ( or their designee ) , who has a business highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue . e - mail , phone or in - person approval will be required from either a business unit head ( or their designee ) or commercial group head ( or their designee ) prior to distribution to enron messaging administration on thursday at 2 : 00 pm .
3 ) if approval is not received prior to the deadline , the business highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received .
4 ) in the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines , all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2 .
i believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months . please advise .
additionally , i have attached the list of contacts kathie uses for gathering entouch information . it includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts . please feel free to comment on this list .
thanks .

it is with sadness and regret that we announce that cliff baxter is resigning as an employee of enron . we are happy , though , that cliff ' s primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family .
cliff is a unique talent . his creativity , intelligence , sense of humor , and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career . he will be missed .
cliff joined enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built enron ' s wholesale business . before becoming vice chairman of enron , cliff served in a variety of positions in enron ' s wholesale businesses , culminating in his appointment as chairman and chief executive officer of enron north america in 1999 .
we have asked cliff , and he has agreed , to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions .

"Subject: california 5 / 25
executive summary :
? legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic plan b
? the keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30 % generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
? despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from burton and his consumer group allies , the keeley plan will probably pass the legislature
? the generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
? pg it will likely take one to two weeks ( more likely closer to two ) to move a deal through the assembly and the senate and to the governor ' s desk once it is introduced .
2 . what would the new plan b look like ?
- this modified plan b deal , which will originate in the assembly , will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay socal ' s undercollect . revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component . it is also very likely that the generators would be offered 70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately , with the possibility of more if they win litigation . ( sources report that the state is "" fairly confident "" that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money . ) assembly speaker keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan , and it is being drawn up from within his office .
3 . transmission lines
- it remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal , since this is a major point of contention between the democrats and republicans . according to sources , the assembly is "" working on this . ""
4 . plan looks good to pass both assembly and senate
- according to sources , the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components ( except the transmission line purchase , which is not yet settled ) "" looks very good . "" the vote in the senate would be "" very close . "" senator burton still opposes a bail - out deal , but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan , making its passage more likely . even opponents of the plan ( including burton and the consumer advocates ) say that the odds of a modified plan b passing the senate are better than 50 - 50 . these opponents are reportedly "" pessimistic "" about their chances of stopping a plan b from passing at this point .
5 . caveat : generators are waiting for guarantees that the witch hunt will end
- as reported previously , sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a 70 cent - on - the - dollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution . ( without this relief , the state could give them 70 cents , then try to take away even more . ) sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution . thus , it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a 30 percent haircut if they were paid immediately . also , sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified plan b would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than 70 cents on the dollar .
- sources believe that socal edison ' s creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through , since it would pay back most of what they are owed .
6 . pg & e could also be dealt in
- if this plan succeeds , it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to pg & e as part of a reorganization plan . this plan can be offered at any time within pg & e ' s "" period of exclusivity . "" this is a 90 - day period ( though it is often extended ) following the filing of a bankruptcy petition .
- however , sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court . based on supreme court precedent ( which legal sources within the state have been reviewing ) , the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court . this is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high .
7 . bailout bill would require follow legislation for a new rate structure
- even if the state passes and signs a socal bailout , it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow socal and pg & e to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy . therefore , this plan does not make the crisis go away .",0

published by the financial times .
the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting
millions of people .
one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due
to power
shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost
of power produced

asia - pacific : power failure hits north india
financial times ; jan 3 , 2001
by angus donald
tens of millions of people were left without electricity
in northern india
yesterday after a power grid breakdown .
electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and
most parts of the
capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply
expected to be restored
by the end of the day , according to power grid
officials .
the associated chambers of commerce and industry
( assocham ) , a
leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""
and called for a
mechanism to prevent future disruption that could
"" cripple the economy "" .
the power failure across eight indian states , including
new delhi , disrupted
train services , water supplies and the telephone network
and forced
hospitals to switch to emergency generators .
the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides
electricity for 226 m
people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,
punjab , uttar pradesh ,
himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu
and kashmir .
a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,
india ' s most
populous state , caused an overload of power on other
lines , which then
failed as well .
trains stopped running for most of the day and signals
systems were
damaged . new delhi international airport was also
slightly affected before
its own power supply could be engaged .
"" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is
most likely to be a
technical failure , but we will investigate why it
happened , "" suresh prabhu ,
the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust
of india .
india suffers regularly from power problems because of
lack of funding to
upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big
problem . thirty per
cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according
to analysts . in new
delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .
two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh
and delhi for
hours .
assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing
industrial demand
would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s
inefficient power
sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in
strengthening the transmission
and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will
contribute to
worsening the power supply situation further . ""

by khozem merchant
enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of
criticism in india , is
hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a
profiteering
multinational .
its "" myth and reality "" offensive in local newspapers
follows the west indian
state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it
pays the texas - based
company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating
plant at dabhol is
india ' s biggest single foreign investment .
maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993
and is three times
greater than that charged by other independent power
producers ( ipps ) .
the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the
rupee against the
dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha
fuel . the state also pays
a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month ,
reflecting the
huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of
consumption .
a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six
years ago that
damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former
official of the world
bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is
emerging "" as the east
india company of the 21 st century "" - a reference to the
british trader that
colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th
century .
the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power
sector . the uk ' s powergen
and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently ,
frustrated by long approval
procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of
higher
returns elsewhere .
"" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven
returns down by six
percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india
general manager
of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat
to china light &
power of hong kong .
india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says
generating capacity
must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since
1992 , ipps have
added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under
construction . this is
insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8
per cent economic
growth .
enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,
winning fast - track project
approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant
fuelled by expensive
naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a
dollars 1 . 87 bn plant
of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied
natural gas ( lng ) ,
will be completed this year . only two of seven other
fast - track proposals
have achieved financial closure .
from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating
in maharashtra ' s
then nationalist government cancelling the project
before renegotiating
terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister
of the successor
government , says the power purchase agreement is
unaffordable .
enron , whose attackers also include cultural
chauvinists , wants to maintain
good political relations in a hostile but lucrative
environment . enron views
india as a testing ground for its evolution from a
traditional manager of
power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,
such as energy , gas
and bandwidth .
to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy
between power
surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed
this year . it is building
an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural
gas . and it is
laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth
space in a country
desperately short of this new economy commodity .
in any event , enron believes it has a watertight
contract . it is supported by
many that believe any subversion of the contract would
confirm investor
perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and
industrial hub , as an
unreliable destination for investment .
mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his
predecessor , which
threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is
under pressure from
radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options
are limited .
scrapping the project would be ruinous for an
economically troubled state
that would have to compensate shareholders .
maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility
and enron ' s main
client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent
of dabhol ' s output . yet
mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take
has averaged 60
per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has
been paying a lot
more while consuming a lot less power .
one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough
new regulator has
told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the
tariff would be
rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but
with off - take a
third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and
often higher . in
october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take
was about 49 per
cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,
run on cheaper
lng , starts .
these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only
half of a 30 per
cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the
balance and
mandated bankers to find a buyer .
enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,

with the stock market telling dynegy inc . that energy trader enron corp . isn ' t worth even half what dynegy has offered to pay , analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which dynegy could bargain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal .
earlier this month , houston - based dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross - town rival in an all - stock deal that currently values enron shares at $ 10 . 85 apiece , or a total of about $ 9 . 2 billion . but in the wake of post - agreement disclosures by enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantially less than expected , the company ' s stock has been hammered . in 1 p . m . trading on the new york stock exchange on friday , enron shares fell 30 cents to $ 4 . 71 . the stock is down 94 % so far this year and far short of the per - share takeover price . dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $ 40 . 40 .
although dynegy and enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated , dynegy does appear to have other options . the agreement with enron contains a broad "" material adverse change "" clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked .
dynegy officials performed "" due diligence "" throughout the holiday weekend , seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of enron , which has suffered a series of damaging blows . since mid - october , enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off enron ' s balance sheet , for a time , to several private partnerships . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation . past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "" accounting error "" by enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since oct . 16 . at one point , enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings .
an enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed . dynegy spokesman john sousa said the two sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk - away provisions "" are broad , by design , to ensure adequate protection for dynegy shareholders . "" shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement .
clauses related to a "" material adverse change , "" also known as a "" material adverse effect , "" have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year , due , in part , to the stock market ' s fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions .
but such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove . both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal , much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins .
furthermore , a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can ' t easily walk away from a merger . in that case , meat - processing concern tyson foods inc . sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat - packer ibp inc . due to a drop in ibp ' s earnings and a write - down of an ibp subsidiary . but a delaware judge refused to let tyson cancel the pact , saying tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of ibp ' s business and the accounting issue .
in a lengthy june 18 opinion , delaware chancery court vice chancellor leo e . strine jr . wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company has suffered a material adverse effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company ' s earnings power over a commercially reasonable period , which one would think would be measured in years rather than months . ""
that interpretation has created ripples in the deal - making community , prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated . since the sept . 11 attacks , for example , a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a "" material adverse change , "" or mac .
a key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is "" whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup , "" says meredith brown , co - chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm debevoise & plimpton in new york . he adds that a court "" may be skeptical "" if dynegy claimed that enron ' s post - merger agreement disclosures were a surprise .
the enron - dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination . enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer , although it is prohibited from soliciting one . in such a case , it could be required to pay a $ 350 million "" topper fee "" to dynegy and its co - investor , chevrontexaco inc .
dynegy can alter the deal if enron faces "" pending or threatened "" litigation liabilities that are "" reasonably likely "" to cost enron $ 2 billion . if those liabilities hit $ 3 . 5 billion "" an enron material event will be deemed to have occurred , "" presumably allowing dynegy to call the whole thing off . in some situations , dynegy would be liable for a $ 350 million fee , as well .
karen denne , the enron spokeswoman , said her firm doesn ' t believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event . the liability must result from litigation . currently , the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors , issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses .
deal makers who aren ' t involved in the combination say the steep drop in enron ' s stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn ' t by itself give dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force enron to renegotiate its terms . instead , they say , dynegy would likely have to prove that enron ' s worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event , which could be difficult in light of the company ' s highly publicized problems and dynegy ' s frequent statement that it clearly understands enron ' s businesses . still , there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow dynegy to terminate the deal if "" any representation or warranty of enron shall have become untrue . ""
other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stock prices that changed an acquisition premium . western resources inc . of topeka , kansas last week sued public service co . of new mexico seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy western ' s utilities . the lawsuit accused public service of breaching its "" duty of good faith and fair dealing "" and said the new mexico company tried to "" sabotage "" the deal as the two companies ' stock prices diverged . public service denies the accusations .

new york - - the options market dozed , as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football .
the chicago board options exchange ' s market volatility index , or vix , which measures certain standard a fall shows investor optimism .
volatility has been dropping from post - sept . 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the taliban in afghanistan and interest - rate cuts by the federal reserve and other central banks . vix ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks .
volatility is likely to remain low , said mika toikka , head of options strategy at credit suisse first boston . "" typically , going into the thanksgiving and december holidays , we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility . we would expect the same this year , especially in markets outside the u . s . where volatility is still lingering at high levels , "" mr . toikka wrote in a recent research note .
the cboe ' s nasdaq volatility index , or vxn , a sentiment barometer for the technology sector , fell 1 . 86 to 50 . 82 while the american stock exchange ' s nasdaq volatility index , or qqv , dropped 1 . 03 to 42 . 74 .
elsewhere in the options market :
calls in enron corp . , the embattled houston energy and trading company , continued to trade briskly , with one investor buying 10 , 000 january 5 calls and simultaneously selling 12 , 250 january 10 calls .
more than 14 , 800 of the january 5 contracts traded , compared with open interest of 3 , 640 , as shares fell 33 cents , or 6 . 6 % , to $ 4 . 68 . these calls cost $ 1 . 40 on the american stock exchange where most of the volume was traded .

it ' s not easy being no . 4 . despite a $ 35 billion merger completed in october , chevrontexaco corp . is still not one of the oil superpowers . nor , at more than $ 90 billion a year in revenues , is it a scrappy little guy . so chairman david j . o ' reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling for more oil and gas .
now , he may have something : a big stake in the no . 1 energy - trading company . chevron corp . has owned 26 % of dynegy inc . since 1996 , and with dynegy ' s planned acquisition of enron corp . , the top energy trader , chevrontexaco is making the oil industry ' s most aggressive push yet into this fast - growing business . it plans to eventually pump $ 2 . 5 billion into the combined dynegy and enron to maintain its 26 % stake , and it might raise that share . so , while chevrontexaco ' s much bigger rivals run small in - house trading operations , energy trading may soon account for more than 10 % of chevrontexaco ' s earnings . ` ` chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business , ' ' says analyst arjun murti at goldman , sachs the most likely target is a natural - gas company . maybe it ' s not so bad being no . 4 .

as houston - based enron corp . imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finances , few would have blamed dynegy inc . ceo charles l . watson if he had sat back and gloated . after all , watson had watched as his bigger , brasher crosstown rival sniffed at dynegy ' s more cautious strategy , all the while garnering most of the credit for reshaping the energy - trading business .
instead , watson picked up the phone on oct . 24 and called enron chairman , ceo , and longtime acquaintance kenneth l . lay to ask how he could help . lay didn ' t respond immediately , but as enron ' s stock continued to plunge and the company faced a cash squeeze , it became clear what the only realistic answer could be : bail us out .
so two days later , lay invited watson to his river oaks home near downtown houston for breakfast to discuss a deal . over muffins and ` ` a bad cup of coffee ' ' the next day , watson recalls , they sketched the outlines , and by 10 p . m . that night , the investment bankers were called in . on nov . 9 , dynegy announced that it would pay about $ 10 billion , plus the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt , to buy enron , which is nearly four times its size . the key to the deal was dynegy ' s immediate $ 1 . 5 billion infusion of cash to shore up enron ' s balance sheet and save its credit rating . the money came from dynegy ' s 26 % owner , chevrontexaco corp .
without that help , enron - - the seventh - largest u . s . company , based on its $ 100 billion in sales last year - - may well have faced bankruptcy . watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams . ` ` i don ' t think anybody foresaw the problems [ at enron ] , ' ' he says . ` ` it ' s been incredible to watch . ' '
watson , 51 , has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet . if he can pull it off , the new dynegy will have revenues of more than $ 200 billion and $ 90 billion in assets , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of power - generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline . it would control an estimated 20 % to 25 % of the energy - trading market , up from about 6 % now .
that would be sweet vindication for watson ' s strategy . dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants , which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer . in contrast , enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil - and gas - generating fields , believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel , pulp , and paper . irresistible bargain . as enron ' s stock slid below $ 9 from its august , 2000 , high of $ 90 , it became a bargain that watson couldn ' t pass up . it would have taken years for dynegy to build up a market - making operation to match enron ' s . its risk - management systems are top - of - the - line . enron ' s commercial - services unit , which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as wendy ' s international inc . , is three or four years ahead of dynegy ' s , says steve bergstrom , president of dynegy . watson says he still plans to get rid of the $ 8 billion worth of assets lay had earmarked for sale , including the portland ( ore . ) general electric plant and oil and gas assets in india . for the $ 1 . 5 billion , though , if the deal falls through dynegy will have the right to enron ' s prized northern natural gas pipeline , worth an estimated $ 2 . 25 billion . and dynegy can walk away if enron ' s legal liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion .
watson firmly believes that enron suffered from a crisis of confidence , not a meltdown of its core business . indeed , enron ' s wholesale - trading operation earned $ 2 . 3 billion last year . says watson : ` ` we know the business . we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we thought it was . ' '
but the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by enron ' s accounting tricks . the biggest danger for watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away . already , the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997 by $ 591 million , or 20 % of its total , to account for controversial partnerships involving enron officials . the securities some compare it to a fraternity . dynegy ' s decision to issue new stock options to some enron employees may soothe battered egos . it should help , too , that lay decided not to take the $ 60 million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout . as it is , lay will not have a management job with the new company .
dynegy often seemed to be an enron wannabe , following it into online trading and commercial services . still , dynegy ' s 361 % stock gains last year eclipsed enron ' s 87 % rise , and it rankled some that lay ' s execs got more credit . ` ` chuck watson may not have been in the spotlight , but he has always been at the forefront of this business , ' ' says bruce m . withers , who sold his trident ngl inc . to dynegy in 1995 . watson will get more attention next year - - he ' s a 15 % owner of the new houston texans pro football team . but with his bold takeover of enron , watson has ensured that he ' s off the sidelines for good .

confused about earnings ? you ' re not alone . here ' s what companies should do - - and what investors need to know

( copyright 2001 mcgraw - hill , inc . )
in an age when giant earnings write - offs have become commonplace , it ' s hard to shock wall street . but on nov . 8 , enron corp . managed to do it . after years of high - octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24 % a year , the houston - based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half - billion dollars . it was confirmation of investors ' worst fears . three weeks earlier , enron had announced a big drop in shareholders ' equity , sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance . management pointed to a number of factors , including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion - dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company ' s net worth .
enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases , but it is hardly alone . this year , corporate america is expected to charge off a record $ 125 billion , much of it for assets , investments , and inventory that aren ' t worth as much as management thought ( chart , page 79 ) . even if companies don ' t go back and restate earnings , as enron is doing , those charges cast doubt on the record - breaking earnings growth of the late ' 90 s .
not since the 1930 s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue - - and so difficult for investors to determine . there ' s more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers . if even the most sophisticated financial minds can ' t figure out what a company actually earns , that has implications far beyond enron . u . s . financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build . it has made the u . s . the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest . it has also ensured ready access to capital for u . s . corporations . that a company such as enron , a member of the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index and one of the largest companies on the new york stock exchange , could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished . ` ` the profession of auditing and accounting is , in fact , in crisis , ' ' says paul a . volcker , former chairman of the federal reserve and now one of the leaders of the international accounting standards board .
sometimes , as in the case of enron , fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings . more often , though , the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways - - and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies , which appear under a variety of names , from ` ` pro forma ' ' to ` ` core . ' ' ( enron offers its own such version . before investors untangled the importance of enron ' s first announcement , its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ` ` recurring net income ' ' had met expectations . ) the resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing : what did my company earn ?
why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place ? because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company ' s prospects . many institutional investors , most wall street analysts , and even many accountants say gaap is irrelevant . ` ` i don ' t know anyone who uses gaap net income anymore for anything , ' ' says lehman brothers inc . accounting expert robert willens . the problem is that gaap includes a lot of noncash charges and one - time expenses . while investors need to be aware of those charges , they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations .
that ' s what operating earnings are supposed to do . but because they ' re calculated in an ad hoc manner , with each company free to use its own rules , comparisons between companies have become meaningless . ` ` no investor - - certainly not any ordinary investor - - can read these in a way that ' s useful , ' ' says harvey l . pitt , chairman of the securities & exchange commission . the sec is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas .
what ' s badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income . in the end , investors need two numbers - - a standardized operating number and an audited net - income number - - and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other . ` ` out of hand . ' ' a widespread consensus is building to do just that . in early november , s & p proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings . only the week before , the financial accounting standards board , the rulemakers for gaap , had announced that they , too , would be taking up this issue . volcker says the international accounting standards board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings .
` ` over the past two or three years , the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand , ' ' says david m . blitzer , s & p ' s chief investment strategist . ` ` earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they ' re trying to evaluate a company . if people want to use an operating - earnings measure , we better all know what we ' re looking at . ' '
without those standards in place , the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to wall street is only going to grow wider and more confusing . look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the s & p 500 for the third quarter : it ' s $ 10 . 78 according to wall street analysts as tallied by thomson financial / first call , $ 9 . 17 according to s & p , and $ 6 . 37 according to numbers reported to the sec under gaap . ( s & p , like businessweek , is owned by the mcgraw - hill companies . )
the lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong . use first call ' s earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price - earnings ratio of 23 for the s & p 500 . but run the numbers using gaap earnings , and suddenly the market has a far steeper p - e of 38 .
how did we get into this mess ? investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years , and for years , reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it . then came the dot - com bubble , along with increased pressure from wall street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts . suddenly , companies that hadn ' t turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants . these customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit . ` ` tower of babel . ' ' pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company , casting doubt on their validity . and these days , the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever . s & p ' s tallies fall between the two : s & p ' s numbers are more systematic than pro forma , but they aren ' t followed widely enough to be a standard . ` ` investors are facing a tower of babel , ' ' says robert k . elliott , former chief of the american institute of certified public accountants ( aicpa ) and a retired kpmg partner . ` ` it ' s not standardized , and the numbers are not audited . ' '
that makes it tough to evaluate a company ' s performance . in the quarter ended on sept . 30 , nortel networks corp . offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from . by conservative gaap accounting , the telecommunications giant lost $ 1 . 08 a share . the company also provided two possible pro forma options : a 68 cents loss that excluded ` ` special charges , ' ' including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges , and a still better 27 cents loss that further excluded $ 1 . 9 billion of ` ` incremental charges , ' ' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables . wall street chose the rosiest one .
confusing ? you bet . companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they ' re merely filling a void : investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company ' s future . the goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations . ` ` there are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings , ' ' says volcker . ` ` it is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company . ' ' besides , as companies like to point out , they still have to report gaap earnings , and investors are free to ignore everything else .
there ' s no starker lesson in the shortcomings of gaap than the $ 50 billion asset write - downs by jds uniphase corp . , the biggest charge of the year . near the height of the telecom bull market in july , 2000 , the san jose ( calif . ) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor sdl inc . for $ 41 billion in stock . when the deal closed in february , its assets ballooned from $ 25 billion to $ 65 billion . but by then , shares of jds and other fiber - optics makers were collapsing . to bring its acquisitions into line with their new value , the company took charges of $ 50 billion . despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid , gaap required that the charges be taken out of net income . so according to gaap , jds lost $ 56 billion in the fiscal year ending in june - - a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only $ 5 billion .
analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash , the charge - off was all about the past , a right - sizing of values that had gotten out of hand . to analyze the company ' s prospects , they excluded the $ 50 billion charge . ` ` the accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened , ' ' says jds uniphase chief financial officer anthony r . muller , ` ` and we ' ll live with the consequences , whatever they are . ' ' analysts make a similar defense . ` ` my goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company , ' ' says lehman brothers analyst arnab chanda . glacial pace . are jds ' s pro forma numbers realistic - - a fair gauge of jds ' s ongoing operations ? right now , it ' s hard for investors to judge . and that ' s the kind of ambiguity s & p and others would like to eliminate . in november , s & p circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings . under the proposal , operating earnings would include the costs of purchases , research and development , restructuring costs ( including severance ) , write - downs from ongoing operations , and the cost to the company of stock options . it would exclude merger - and - acquisition expenses , impairment of goodwill , litigation settlements , and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset .
when s & p applied roughly that formula to jds uniphase , it split the difference between wall street and gaap . because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations , the results were chaotic . using gaap , the company lost $ 9 . 39 a share . s & p figures it lost $ 3 . 19 , while the company put the loss at 36 cents . meanwhile , wall street says it made 2 cents .
the s & p standard may make sense , but it raises the question : where is the financial accounting standards board , the group in charge of gaap ? chairman edmund l . jenkins says fasb will be addressing the problems . still , investors shouldn ' t expect any improvement soon . the pace of change at fasb tends to be glacial . it typically takes four years to complete a new standard . in 1996 , for example , the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda . in june , 2000 , the board finally issued a draft of a new standard , asked for comments , and held a public hearing . in october , 2001 , the board said it still wasn ' t ready to put a fix in place . now , the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges , and the fasb still doesn ' t have new rules .
the slow pace means the standard - setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market . the most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on september 11 . an fasb task force , unable to come up with a set of rules for separating september 11 costs from general expenses , instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item . so gaap earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company ' s general performance . many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press releases .
many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter . indeed , 2001 is shaping up to be one for the record books . a poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of september 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen . but there ' s a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one - time charges . the temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now , while investors are braced for bad news . not only can managers sweep away yesterday ' s errors , but tomorrow ' s earnings will look even better .
the basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense - - a charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a company ' s performance . usually , big charges fall into a few categories , including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company , charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased , charges for investments that have lost value , and charges for inventory that has become obsolete . in a recent study , harvard business school professor mark t . bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual . that gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations .
lots of critics disagree , saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company ' s earnings history . they certainly should not be ignored by investors . ` ` charges are real shareholder wealth that ' s been lost , ' ' argues david w . tice , manager of the prudent bear fund , a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that ' s up 17 % so far this year . ` ` it ' s money they spent on something no longer worth what it was , a correction of past earnings , or a reserve for costs moving forward . whatever the reason , it ' s a real cost to the company , and that hurts shareholders . ' ' without standards , excessive write - offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance . without any rules , companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light . dell computer corp . is a good example of this ` ` heads i win , tails you lose ' ' school of accounting . for years , dell benefited from gains in its venture - capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings , where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement . but this year , when those gains turned to losses , the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $ 260 million drag . dell spokesman michael maher says the company ' s press releases and sec filings break out investment income and give gaap numbers as well as pro forma . ` ` in our view , the numbers are reported clearly , ' ' says maher . ` ` it ' s all out there for the consuming public . ' ' past puffery . many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated . what should investors make of a company such as gateway inc . ? two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters , minus a small extraordinary gain , totaled $ 1 . 12 billion , or about $ 100 million more than the company made in 1998 , 1999 , and 2000 combined . which is the truer picture of its performance and potential ? the write - offs or the earnings ? write - offs for customer financing are another example . when nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by $ 767 million in september , it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldn ' t pay - - in effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods . in addition , nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues . tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write - offs . and these aren ' t isolated examples . peter l . bernstein , publisher of newsletter economics & portfolio strategy , found that from 1989 to 1993 , 20 % of earnings vanished into write - offs .
big charge - offs can also distort future performance . critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of ` ` cookie jar ' ' from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet wall street ' s expectations . or charges taken this year , for example , which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway , might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods . prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings . rules for figuring operating earnings would help , but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgment - - and therefore invite a certain amount of abuse . ` ` people are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because they ' re having a bad year anyway , ' ' says robert g . atkins , a mercer management consultant .
part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off , believing that with the bad news out in the open , the company is poised for a brighter future . since gateway detailed its third - quarter charge of $ 571 million on oct . 18 , wall street has bid the stock up 48 % , compared with a 6 % runup for the s & p 500 .
often , though , investors should take exactly the opposite message . if , for example , part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training , information - technology spending , or research and development , the cuts could depress future performance , says baruch lev , a professor of accounting at the stern school of business at new york university . ` ` are these really one - time events ? ' ' he asks . ` ` or is this the beginning of an avalanche ? ' ' indeed , morgan stanley dean witter & co . strategist steve galbraith has found that in the year following a big charge - off to earnings companies have underperformed the stock market by 20 percentage points . ` ` la la land . ' ' investors are apt to be faced with more huge write - offs next year , even if the economy doesn ' t continue to worsen . why ? the transition to a new gaap rule that changes the way companies account for goodwill - - a balance - sheet asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets . under the new rule , companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls . an informal survey by financial executives international of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charges .
but figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task . unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price , valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules . ` ` what this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment , ' ' says the stern school ' s professor paul r . brown . ` ` it ' s la la land . ' '
while the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games , it could also be an impetus for change - - especially in the wake of the dot - com fiasco . indeed , there are some signs of a backlash . the real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings , with its ` ` funds from operations , ' ' or ffo . but now some reits have begun to revert to plain old gaap earnings . hamid r . moghadam , ceo of san francisco - based amb property corp . , shifted back to gaap in 1999 . ` ` the reason i don ' t like ffo is very simple , ' ' says moghadam . ` ` one company ' s numbers look better than another one ' s even if they had identical fundamental results . ' '
there are other steps fasb could take to improve financial reporting and restore gaap ' s status . trevor s . harris , an accounting expert at morgan stanley , says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income from operations and income from financial transactions . lehman ' s willens says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear on earnings . an easy step would be to require companies to file their press releases with the sec .
at the least , says lev , companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the gaap numbers . otherwise , he says , investors ` ` see numbers floating there , and where did they come from ? ' ' in today ' s environment of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write - offs , no question is more important to investors .
high - gloss glossary
companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin on
their results . here ' s what those terms mean :
defining earnings :
net income
the bottom line , according to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) .
sometimes called ` ` reported earnings , ' ' these are the numbers the securities &
exchange commission accepts in its filings .
operating earnings
an adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelated
to the ongoing business . although it sounds deceptively like a gaap figure
called ` ` operating income ' ' ( revenue minus the costs of doing business ) , it is
not an audited figure .
core earnings
another term for operating earnings . neither core nor operating earnings are
calculated according to set rules . they can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes .
pro forma earnings
the 1990 s term for operating earnings . popularized by dot - coms , it sometimes
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest .
ebitda
earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization . the
granddaddy of pro forma , it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads , such as cable tv , but has since come to be widely
quoted .
adjusted earnings
a new term for pro forma .
defining costs :
special charges
a general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections .
asset impairments
charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its
current market value . many companies are now taking these charges on internal
venture - capital funds that bought internet and other high - tech stocks at
inflated prices .
goodwill impairments
the same idea as asset impairments except they ' re used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets
acquired . these charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because of a
change in mergers - and - acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values .
restructuring reserves
an accrued expense ( not usually cash ) to cover future costs of closing down a
portion of a business , a plant , or of firings . these are projected costs and
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed .
write - down
lowering the value of an asset , such as a plant or stock investment . it is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise , but there may have been a real cost
long ago that now proves ill spent , or there may have been associated cash
costs , such as investment - banking fees .

what did the company earn ? that ' s the most basic question an investor can ever ask . the equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer , but getting one has become impossible . enron corp . just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars . how did one of the biggest companies on the new york stock exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20 % without auditors , analysts , ratings agencies , and the business press ( businessweek included ) discovering it ? in part , blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of corporate america . the u . s . needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance . without integrity in financial reporting , the u . s . cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace ( page 76 ) .
the dot - com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards . companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations . wall street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in . soon , the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company . it is now chaos .
a stricter adherence to accounting rules won ' t solve the entire problem . gaap , the generally accepted accounting principles , allow all kinds of one - time expenses and noncash charges . this obscures the performance of ongoing operations . no one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense . the result is total confusion . take earnings per share for the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index for the second quarter . under thomson financial / first call standards , it is $ 11 . 82 . but it ' s $ 9 . 02 according to s & p and $ 4 . 83 under gaap . how can investors make intelligent decisions ?
the financial accounting standards board clearly is failing to do its job . it has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings , but it hasn ' t delivered . the rating agency standard & poor ' s ( owned by the mcgraw - hill companies , as is businessweek ) is doing a better job . it recently drew up a definition of ` ` operating earnings ' ' that includes restructuring costs ( including severance ) , writedowns from ongoing operations , and the cost of stock options . it excludes merger and acquisition expenses , litigation settlements , impairment of goodwill , and gains or losses on asset sales . this is a beginning that fasb should build on . the accounting anarchy has to end .

back in enron ' s heyday , one of its rising stars was rebecca mark . nicknamed ` ` mark the shark ' ' because of her ferocious ambition , she made her name in the early ' 90 s building the energy giant ' s international operations , including the now - troubled dabhol power plant in india . once rumored to be a successor to enron ceo ken lay , she resigned from enron in august , 2000 , after two years of heading enron ' s ailing water company spin - off , azurix .
these days , as enron struggles to stay afloat , mark - jusbasche ( who hyphenated her name with that of her husband of two years ) is watching the action from the sidelines . and she ' d like to keep it that way . ` ` i ' m very surprised and saddened by [ what has happened at enron ] , and i wish them all the best , ' ' she says . beyond that , mark - jusbasche , 47 , is not much interested in talking about enron , which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectacular wall street flameout . mark left enron with millions of dollars worth of enron shares , although she says she has sold them since .
mark - jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards , both at yale and harvard business schools , as well as the school where her 16 - year - old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores .
in her spare time , she seeks out opportunities for investing . currently , mark - jusbasche is considering alternative - energy and water - technology companies . a farm girl from missouri , she has one investment focus that ' s especially dear to her heart : looking into expanding her cattle ranches . she now owns 15 acres in new mexico . ` ` i ' m doing things that are fun , interesting , and important to me - - family and community , ' ' she says . sure beats being anywhere near enron .

enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $ 500 m to $ 1 bn into the group , as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown at the energy trading group .
dynegy , whose rescue bid for its houston rival is crucial to enron ' s survival , spent last week ' s thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing enron ' s operations and finances .
dynegy said it remained "" optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed , and in the time - frame we originally announced - six to nine months "" .
enron ' s fate depends on a delicate , unofficial pact between its lenders , dynegy , and credit ratings agencies , which have resisted downgrading the group ' s debt while the deal is pending .
if the pact stays in place , at least $ 500 m is likely to be invested in enron by jp morgan chase and citigroup , enron ' s key lenders and advisers . a further $ 500 m is being sought from private equity firms .
but if dynegy pulls out of the deal , the cash infusion could be put in jeopardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk , triggering debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off - balance - sheet vehicles linked to enron .
enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity from new equity investors , but would not discuss their identities .
enron ' s crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fell from $ 9 to $ 4 . 74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent of the group ' s debt burden .
completion of a $ 1 bn secured credit line from jpm chase and citigroup , and the postponement of a $ 690 m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficient to prop up the share price . the bonds also fell to levels consistent with a potential bankruptcy filing .
the slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that dynegy is preparing to renegotiate its all - stock bid , now worth $ 9 . 3 bn , compared with enron ' s market value of $ 3 . 5 bn .

schwab chief ' s main theme : diversification
by lynnette khalfani
dow jones newswires
11 / 26 / 2001
the wall street journal
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - - more than two months after the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , many investors remain edgy . but the stock market , after an initial selloff , has shown remarkable resilience .
few observers expect stock - market volatility to subside soon . still , experts say that now , more than ever , is the time for skittish investors to keep their wits about them .
in a recent interview , charles r . schwab , chairman and co - chief executive of charles schwab & co . , the san francisco - based online and discount brokerage firm , gave his views on what investors should be doing - - and what mistakes they should avoid .
here are some excerpts from the interview :
in the wake of the sept . 11 attacks , how much more risk , if any , do you think is in the financial markets ? or do you think it ' s just that people ' s perceptions about risk have changed ?
i ' ve been investing since 1959 , and i have to say that , year after year , the risk hasn ' t changed . the risk is always there . there ' s risk in investing in stocks , bonds and even u . s . treasuries because of interest - rate [ fluctuations ] . there ' s risk in real estate , too .
so the question is : how do you handle it ? the best way is to diversify . over a long period of time , people who diversify their investments do pretty darned well . when they don ' t . . . sometimes it ' s fatal . if the only stock an investor owned was enron . . . or cisco at 70 , that was pretty fatal .
what do you say to people who say they ' re too scared to invest right now ? that because of the threat of terrorism , the anthrax scares , the war in afghanistan , the recession , and so forth , there ' s just too much uncertainty in the markets ?
i remember back during the cuban missile crisis , we all feared the worst . we were all building bomb shelters . it was a scary time . this terrorist thing is no different . it ' s awful - - particularly for our children . but this country is so wealthy , in terms of its resources , intellectual capital and the strength of our government .
there is no more uncertainty today than in times past . for example , we ' ve had many recessions . it ' s not fun , especially when you begin reading about all these layoffs . in fact , i think the unemployment rate [ now at 5 . 4 % ] pretty easily might get to 6 . 5 % before it gets better . and it probably won ' t get better until march or april . also , the stock market will go up , hopefully before the economy goes up .
there ' s $ 2 trillion sitting in money - market accounts . that ' s a huge resource and buying power that ' s definitely available for new investments .
what do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past two or so months ?
they let their emotions take over . with the fear that people had , they didn ' t use their rational thinking . they used their emotional thinking . [ after sept . 11 ] , they sold at the low , and fear was the driver .
just a year and a half ago , the driving emotion was greed . you ' re not going to avoid this stuff . so the issue is how you manage through these cycles of fear and greed . even when i ' m fearful of something , i say to myself : "" this is still the time to invest . ""
my biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say , "" i just don ' t want to be in the stock market at all . "" and it ' s just the time that people should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio .
some other mistakes : a lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poster child of the last cycle . or people say , "" i ' ll get back in [ the market ] when i see the economy turn around . "" well , by the time they see that , it ' s too late . they will have missed the whole ride back up .

enron pursuing a cash infusion energy : company is seeking as much as $ 1 billion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by dynegy .

houston - - enron corp . said talks are continuing with potential investors for an infusion of as much as $ 1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by dynegy inc .
an investment would ease concern that enron ' s weakened finances may prompt dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction , which is valued at $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt .
enron is seeking an additional $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in cash but wouldn ' t divulge details . "" we are not going to discuss the particulars of who we are talking to , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said sunday .
shares of the houston company fell by 48 % in the last three trading sessions on the new york stock exchange . at friday ' s closing price of $ 4 . 71 , the stock sells for less than half the $ 10 . 85 that dynegy is slated to pay in the acquisition . that ' s a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will go through as planned .
enron is likely to have approached kohlberg , kravis roberts & co . , blackstone group and carlyle group for a private equity investment , said industry analyst david snow of . net .
the firms have declined to comment .
in a conference call nov . 14 , enron chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to receive $ 500 million to $ 1 billion from those sources .
on wednesday , enron got a three - week reprieve from lenders on a $ 690 - million note due this week , gaining more time to restructure its finances . dynegy chief executive chuck watson said he was "" encouraged "" by the commitment to extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $ 450 - million credit facility . he said dynegy remained committed to the purchase .
enron already received $ 1 . 5 billion in cash nov . 13 from chevrontexaco inc . as part of the dynegy buyout agreement . in return , dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas co . pipeline . under the deal ' s terms , if dynegy and enron fail to merge , dynegy can acquire the pipeline company .
but barron ' s reported over the weekend that dynegy ' s right to the pipeline might be challenged by j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . , which accepted the asset as collateral for $ 1 billion in loans to enron .
dynegy spokesman john sousa declined to comment on enron ' s attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for enron is a condition of keeping the merger alive .
enron ' s dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investigation of the company , which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratings cut .
the company said in a securities and exchange filing a week ago that it has less than $ 2 billion in cash and credit lines left .

enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management . it put in systems to manage risks on a real - time basis and had very strong management . "" james lam , founder of erisk , a consulting firm .
as an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks , i have been an admirer of enron ' s elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices . and yet , in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid - october , it lost two - thirds of its share value , became the subject of a us securities exchange commission ( sec ) investigation , and was taken over by a rival a third in size . ( latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through . ) what went wrong ?
no , the events had nothing to do with dabhol . indeed , if , for us in india , enron will always be associated with the controversial power project , elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting , finance and general management . ( on second thoughts , even its indian adventures would make an excellent case study ! )
but first , a recount of what happened . after announcing on october 16 , without much explanation or transparency , that it has taken a charge of $ 1 . 2 billion against equity , enron ' s share price started tumbling . apparently , the charge was the result of some financial transactions , and the sec launched an investigation . the chief financial officer ( cfo ) , who was directly involved with the transactions , the company ' s treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked .
perhaps most damagingly , enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards , reducing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount . as a result , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded .
it seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading , but in its investment activities controlled by the cfo . these comprised private equity , and enron ' s share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts . to this end , outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in enron itself , should the value of the investee company ( ies ) fall below agreed threshold ( s ) .
all this was done to keep the losses in investments off - balance sheet , and mitigate their impact on reported profits . many other us corporations including j p morgan chase , which had large private equity investments , have suffered on this score ( see world money october 15 ) . enron wanted to avoid this and , last year , paid its since - dismissed cfo $ 30 million for his creative accounting genius .
incidentally , those enamoured of us gaap and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company ' s auditors one of the big five firms , which was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by enron last year .
the restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the enron management / board and the auditors were forced , on review , to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on , rather than off , balance sheet . details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out , but what has come out is bad enough .
but this apart , a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ( $ 300 billion ) or cash flow ( $ 3 billion ) of enron is , by itself , hardly a death warrant . but it turned out to be just that for enron .
perhaps because it was too arrogant ? perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors ' confidence was always somewhat fragile ?
but there are two other points worth noting : the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing . as for the first , the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts , but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject . perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "" masters of the universe "" did , not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars . the enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas , with skilling , the former ceo , claming that "" we are on the side of angels . we are taking on the entrenched monopolies . we are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world . "" ( the quotation is from an interview in businessweek , prior to skilling ' s inglorious exit from enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst ) .
for the analysts , there was also safety in numbers . skilling claimed that "" enron ' s operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies "" , bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas ! obviously , the fate of long term capital management has not led to more sober management of trading risks .
surely the role of "" markets "" should be to reduce the distance , and cost , between producer and consumer ? one does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values , in terms of compensation , the trader ( don ' t forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator ) over the producer whether in the bond , currency or power and gas markets . the markets and , indeed , greed obviously have a role to play , but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left ?

india ' s mehta comments on birla group offer to buy enron stake
2001 - 11 - 26 03 : 42 ( new york )
mumbai , nov . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - jaywantiben mehta , india ' s
union minister of state for power , comments on reports of aditya
birla group , which owns grasim industry ltd . , the nation ' s third -
biggest cement maker , bidding for enron ' s stake in dabhol power
co .
enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in dabhol power ,
india ' s biggest foreign investment , at cost . the project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $ 64 million in bills that haven ' t been
paid by the maharashtra state electricity board , its only
customer , for eight months .
` ` one more bidder will increase competition , which is
welcome .
` ` any step in the national interest is good .
` ` cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price .
` ` i can ' t comment on the time - frame of buying out the enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved . once that ' s cleared ,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly . ' '

brian ,
this was not a replacement for any meeting . i had intented this to be a working / decision making / resolution meeting
for energy ops .
i have a group of people working on various issues that are interdependent . this was a chance for
them to hear progress from the different areas . we included it because most of our issues are dependent
on them completing certain items before we can move ahead .

hi christie ,
when do you sleep ? 2 am , ugh !
ok , you were correct , my invitation was to those people within enron that
the students talked with before interviewing competitors , and it was an
invitation to the presentation only . i didn ' t think any of them would be
invited to the dinner , and probably none will even come to the presentation .
the invitation did elicit one request for the final report though , so maybe
it wasn ' t a complete waste .
i didn ' t realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit . that sounds
great . i wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game ,
that would have made the whole slumming experience better . now they ' ll get
the royal treatment at enron field . it ' ll be great .

dennis w . loughridge , director of energy consortium ; lounghrid @ rice . edu

"Subject: memo from office of the chair
the mid - year performance management cycle will begin on may 15 with the
opening of the pep system ( the online "" performance evaluation process ""
feedback system ) . you will be receiving your password for this system in a
note to go out later from pep . in preparation for the cycle , four training
classes will be offered to all new employees and to those employees who have
not previously attended training . enrollment for these classes will be
offered through the development center "" ernie "" system . for employees who are
outside the houston area , please contact your hr representative for more
information .
these sessions will be held on :
wednesday , may 10 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . , and three sessions to be held on
thursday , may 11 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 00 a . m . ; 1 : 30 - 2 : 30 p . m . ; and 3 : 00 - 4 : 00 p . m .
all sessions will be held at the doubletree hotel .
to register , click on this link to go directly to the development center
for those of you who have attended the training before and who are familiar
with the past performance management process , there have been some
modifications :
1 . the performance management process is now enron wide . all enron feedback
forms have been reduced to three ( vice president ( vp ) / managing director
( md ) ; management / professional ; and administration / support ) , which all use
the following criteria :
? innovation / entrepreneurship
? communication / setting direction
? teamwork / interpersonal
? leadership / vision / values
? business instinct
? analytical / technical
2 . the following six performance ratings will be used consistently on the
final feedback forms across enron :
superior
excellent
strong
satisfactory
needs improvement
issues
3 . there will be four recognized peer groups across the company for purposes
of the prc ( formerly the business review meetings ) meeting .
? commercial
? commercial support
? technical
? specialized technical
4 . the performance review process will continue to be used to facilitate :
? promotions - up to director level only . there will be no officer promotions
to vp / md at mid - year
? feedback to employee
? compensation decisions
? sharing of performance rating at manager  , s discretion
5 . prc meetings will be reviewed by both functional area & business units
both functional areas and business units will participate in the rating of
employees to cover both solid and dotted line reporting relationships .
functional prc meetings will take place first , followed by the final business
unit meetings . difference in views on an individual employee  , s rating should
be discussed and consensus should be reached . the functional area meetings
are :
- accounting
- human resources
- government affairs
- rac
- global finance
6 . the pep system is now available via the intranet to allow greater access
from global locations and remotely . the functionality is essentially the
same . if you would like further information on how to use this system you may
gain access to the quick reference guide by clicking on the attached
weblinkhttp : / / home . enron . com / announce / . pdf . if the
quick reference does not display correctly on your pc , call your help desk
for assistance , or irma alvarez at 713 - 853 - 1543 to get a hard copy .
7 . the general responsibilities remain the same regarding the overall
process :
employee / reviewer responsibilities :
select 5 - 7 reviewers
complete self - assessment
complete requested feedback forms
reviewers who cannot provide feedback use the decline request feature
supervisor responsibilities :
approve reviewers ( at least 3 of the employee ' s choices )
communicate modifications to employee
participate in prc meetings as required
summarize feedback and complete appropriate feedback form
communicate feedback to the employee
schedule for mid - year performance review
may 15 pep system opens for feedback
june 9 pep system closes for feedback
june 12 functional / business unit prc meetings begin
july 20 prc meetings should finish
july 31 / august 1 vp & md prc meeting
as always , if you have further questions on the performance management
process , you may contact your hr representative .",0
"Subject: fw : ipp update : analysis of power market conditions
indicatesselling was overdone ; focus on cpn and mir

subject : ipp update : analysis of power market conditions
indicatesselling was overdone ; focus on cpn and mir
good morning ,
attached , please find our latest update on the ipp sector , which includes an
analysis of recent power market conditions
>
1 . focus on cpn and mir on july 24 , 2001 , our ipp composite traded off 8 % ,
owing to heightened market concerns surrounding "" soft "" spot and forward
power prices . we believe the weakness presents a buying opportunity across
the whole section and recommend that investors focus on our top 2 picks :
calpine ( cpn , strong buy ) and mirant ( mir , buy ) .
2 . power market analysis in this note we include an analysis of recent
power market conditions . we conclude that power market conditions have been
more stable than is generally believed . further , if conditions had
worsened , the earnings impact would not be severe . on that basis we believe
the sell - off across the sector was overdone .
3 . beware of national power indices ! in order to properly analyze recent
power price fluctuations , it is key to analyze the california market
separately . outside of california , spark spreads have actually increased by
2 . 7 % on average since may in a number of key markets . within california ,
there have been large declines in pricing and margins . however , potential
returns on capital in that market remain well above anywhere else in the
country .
4 . ipps are not call options on power prices ! the bulk of the group has
contracted substantial portions of their output . in particular , calpine has
sold forward 90 % of its output in 2001 and 80 % in 2002
5 . current valuations reflect the investor uncertainties 2001 and 2002 p / e
multiples have compressed by more than 40 % year to date
6 . buy on weakness to the extent earnings prospects remain intact , we view
the recent weakness as irrational .

the english language . have you ever wondered why foreigners have trouble with the english language ? . let ' s face it . english is a crazy language . there is no egg in the eggplant
no ham in the hamburger . and neither pine nor apple in the pineapple . english muffins were not invented in england . french fries were not invented in france . we sometimes take english for granted but if we examine its paradoxes we find that quicksand takes you down slowly , boxing rings are square . and a guinea pig is neither from guinea nor is it a pig . if writers write , how come fingers don ' t fing . if the plural of tooth is teeth . shouldn ' t the plural of phone booth be phone beeth , if the teacher taught , why didn ' t the preacher praught . if a vegetarian eats vegetables . what the does a humanitarian eat ? why do people recite at a play , yet play at a recital ? park on driveways and drive on parkways . you have to marvel at the unique lunacy . of a language where a house can burn up as it burns down . and in which you fill in a form by filling it out . and a bell is only heard once it goes ! english was invented by people , not computers , and it reflects the creativity of the human race ( which of course isn ' t a race at all ) that is why when the stars are out they are visible , but when the lights are out they are invisible , and why it is that when i wind up my watch it starts , but when i wind up this observation , it ends .

my feedback :
philip has an excellent cv and background - - - phd coursework at university
of chicago , and work experience at long term capital ( hopefully he learned
something ) . his views are somewhat idealistic - - - his aim is to make
bid - offers in any product , and he could not really address how he would
handle illiquidity . nevertheless , if bryan needs traders , he can fit the
role .
zak seemed somewhat unfocused . he has worked on a variety of projects , but
does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do . he
seemed very academically oriented , and might be hard to communicate and work
with . i do not see him working in the trenches , and i do not see him leading
the group either . he would be a good person to brainstorm ideas with .

can research in houston put together a comparison of the long - term volatility

difference out beyond 10 years . fundamentally , it seems like the long - term

has research done any work on this in the past ? if not , we should study this

thursday morning session - - - - meeting with state commissioners
this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process . although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend , upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame . it was a long morning ! i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts .
approximately 35 to 40 % of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts . most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support . everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc , primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process , that ferc was moving too quickly , and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens . in particular , the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric . while many would think that the session was extremely negative ( our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting ! ) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing - - allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis .
here ' s some individual comments :
catherine riley / maryland - - - she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens ( she was way overboard in the dramatics department ) . she then stated that she was not at the meeting to "" help you ( ferc ) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record "" . it went on like this for about 15 minutes . the good part is that she was so personally negative , that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her .
sam ervin / north carolina - - - he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens , that customer choice is never coming to his state , so he will never benefit from an rto , that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto ( and i bet if they do , he ' ll work to change the statutes ! ) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc . his comments were also pretty brutal , but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor .
arnetta mcrae / delware - - - she kept on saying "" show me "" where the benefits for consumers are . she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order .
rory mcminn / new mexico - - - repeatedly talked about how the west was different , how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers , how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were .
carl wood / california - - tried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole , and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments . he delivered the same messages that we ' ve been hearing forever - - - ferc should have acted sooner on price caps , etc etc .
glen thomas / pennsylvania - - - he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it ' s energy system into the new century . . . that by opening it ' s markets they have had an explosion in green power , they have reduced costs all across the state , etc . he was very supportive of pjm ( makes sense because it ' s in his back yard ) and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance .
judy jones / ohio - - - was very parochial in her discussion , but echoed don svanda ' s comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed .
ed garvey / minnesota - - - he got the gold star for the day . after very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners , he took about 1 minute and said "" ferc - - just get it done "" . . . . in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward .
other commissioners who talked were : arthur / connecticut , hadley / indiana , huelsman / kentucky , nugent / maine all on the positive side . other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do .
from the ferc commissioner standpoint , the gold star went to massey . after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn ' t feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough , he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back , saying the "" there has been 7 years of process , and he wants a process that comes to an end . . . . you ' ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree . . .

"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak
erin ,
a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent
non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most
important
references to more advanced books and papers .
the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page .
the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options
and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with
the presentation materials available if you are interested .
we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall .
the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general
concept of real options
and their applicability to the energy business .
the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used
to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case
studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired
power plants ) .
the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the
problem of making
investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this
is a
perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other
techniques developed
earlier .
discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through
analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely ,
optimistic ,
pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers
and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions .
the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture
uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that
allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to
downside risk .
this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and
future
operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options
that are exercised
in the future through active management of a project .
the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to
come
up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real
challenge is
to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30
years
of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants
armed with
powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the
challenge is not
to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions
but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand
specific businesses
into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to
stress - test the assumptions
of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends
critically on any set of assumptions .
if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying
assumptions .
i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the
dynamics of oil prices ,
but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very
optimistic upward trend .
one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question
what economics 101
teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand .

thereafter . i do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as i do . many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the lst division so we need to set a practice schedule . how do tuesday and
thursday nights look for you guys ? we also need a field we can count
on . . . . ideas anyone ? in the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind . . . running twice a week 4 - 6 miles would be a good start . if we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized i am sure we ' ll be a
very competitive lst division team . i have been paid by mike z . , kevin ,
adam , scott , jon b . , mike b . , jay , justin , declan , tristan , and jacob . the

mark ,
steve ' s comment has many merits . i think stinson gibner and grant masson
( physics ph . d . ' s ) can help to identify
academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims .
on the other hand , even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in
their time estimates , the technology
they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous
potential payoffs . it make sense to
stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities .

i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2 - 3
years from commercial production . ideally , we could get that confirmation
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest
in its success . their technology pitch sounded good , but i don ' t know enough
to recognize the potential shortcomings . i want to feel comfortable that you
all feel this is real , then i would be happy to have me and my team spend
some time with them .

thank you for participating in yesterday ' s meeting . we spoke with harvey and
jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart .
there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
development of their company , but it seems the one thing they want is the one
thing we also want , people . i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship . given our
resource constraints , this would most likely be part of the organization that
sees the greatest strategic impact from mec ' s development .

subject : qf projects summary
all projects are owned in a trs / foe structure ( total return swap / friend of enron ) as a result of our continued ownership in portland general .
the two current east project companies are motown and cornhusker .
motown consists of two 50 % interests and has trs of about $ 56 million and is on the balance sheet for about $ 2 million :
michigan power - 129 mw power plant fully contracted for power 20 + years and 14 remaining years of fixed cost gas . the ppa is deep in the money versus cost to generate ( even after the swapped gas in 2015 ) . dynegy operates and is managing general partner ( "" mgp "" ) and operator . fair performance record on both at best . michigan is currently entering into qf stranded cost filings and the time is near to propose a restructuring . we have waited for about 9 months as doug clifford ( the origination on the purchase ) had been attempting to purchase dynegy ' s interest ( they have too high a book value and are accrual based ) .
the proposed restructuring will take the form of an upfront payment in return for an option to provide power from the market . this approach gives consumer ' s ( a bbb credit ) much needed cash at a time when they are significantly underrecovering due to increased fuel costs and set fuel recovery rates . consumer ' s ( like many other utilities ) has a hard time seeing their exposure ( purchased power cost certainty for the volume and term ) and doesn ' t see any regulatory filing complications with their current stranded cost filings .
the amended ppa is a non - unit contingent power short which we fill long - term with a contract from the power desk . the desk takes the obligation because generation investments provides a full backstop pricing through their ownership of the plant and the swapped gas ( we either float past the swapped gas or contract for differences those years with the gas desk ) . the ppa and desk contract are securitized in the capital markets for the term of the ppa at 1 . 05 dscr and about 75 bps over consumer ' s current corporate bonds . the plant essentially becomes a $ 0 npv machine and the power desk has significant optionality to call from the market rather than the plant for 20 + years . during the term of the swapped gas , when the plant isn ' t called by the desk we can sell the gas into the market for a profit .
it is fairly easy to see the increased value . the project is currently project financed at about 1 . 5 dscr for about 14 years ( lots of cash ) . the desk has significant optionality and always a matched cost supply with the plant . the plant gains efficiency due to revised o & m , insurance , reserves , etc . which are no longer required due to the removal of project financing .
difficulties - dynegy and consumers . consumers can be rational . dynegy either must sell or play along . current operational / project management issues which dynegy caused may make their interest available .
ada - 29 mw plant fully contracted for power 20 + years . enron is the mgp . ge operates for us . 50 % owned by coned . fixed gas through 2008 . we would propose a restructuring at the same time as michigan power ( this would leave consumers with only one unrestructured ppa ) . currently revisiting buying comed ' s interest .
cornhusker - trs of about $ 206 and about $ 24 on balance sheet . a 100 % interest in a single 250 mw plant in texas . small coop which is very litigious . plant has had some rather spectacular failures ( i have pictures which make the engineers on our floor shudder which i would be glad to pass along ) but the ppa only requires 60 % availability before significantly in the money capacity payments are reduced ( essentially an impossible to reach loss ) . the failures have been related ( westinghouse 501 f ) . carl tricoli spent the first 7 months ( upto february ) trying to sell the project to the coop . we spent last month determining that the coop will never buy the project ( they just don ' t have the $ and we are a very expensive lender . we ' re taking a last stab at a restructuring proposal in the coming month and upon appraisal of the coop ' s intentions , we ' ll potentially enter the sell mode . el paso has indicated an interest in the project already as the ex - citizen ' s employee ' s over there attempted to restructure some time ago . if we sell the closing should be by 9 / 30 / 01 .
again , i apologize for the delay in getting you this info . call with questions .

john ,
we have asked every single counterparty in the nw to sell us energy . we bid $ 300 to powerx and were told that they were abiding by the cap .
we are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue to do so .

subject : montana power company ( mpc ) energy imbalance
bill ; mike cashell ( mpc ' s transmission mgr . ) just phoned me concerned , because mpc ' s real - time group requested epmi purchase energy for them under our existing energy imbalance structure , and was notified by our real - time group that due to the newly implemented ferc price cap , we were have difficulty securing any resources . just to clarify things , we are settling mpc ' s choice customers energy imbalance position , and pp & l montana has the right to any length resulting from mpc ' s "" domestic "" load energy imbalance . in other words mpc is settling two separate energy imbalance accounts , so during the hour they may be turning energy back to pp & l montana , while at the same time finding themselves short for the choice loads . during the recent bullish pricing conditions , choice customer were leaving themselves long , as of late , mpc is experiencing the choice customers doing the opposite , positioning themselves short . the net result is that mpc will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on , so i ' d really like to see what we can do to honor their requests , mindful of the favorable position we ' ve enjoyed over the last several months . let me know if you ' d like to discuss this further , or better yet if you ' ve got a workable solution to the problem . in the meantime , thanks again to you and your staff for the outstanding performance thus far in dealing with mpc . john",0
"Subject: 2000 plan allocations and january allocations
please read brian ' s memo below . we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting . i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the 2000 plan allocations . please note that we were not making
changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet . rather they are reflected on the 1 / 00
allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .
i need each of you to review the 2000 plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today , and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for 1 / 00 . what
has your group spent their time on in 1 / 00 ? ? ? please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .
one other thing to note : the network trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups : trading ( tom martin and jim schwieger ) and
transportation ( ed gottlob ) . although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown , please include it in yours .
i would like you allocations back to me no later than thursday , 1 / 20 @
3 : 00 pm . thanks .

subject : 2000 plan allocations and january allocations
the attached files contain the allocation percentages for 2000 plan , january
2000 actuals and a description of the new assets teams .
please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the
assets team . the assets team is now broken out into the following "" groups ""
which are described in the attached word document :
rc # team name rc owner
the 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams , please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets ( which is in the
executive column ) and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support . i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain , which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group . consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination . i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion .
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 2000
actuals . i have added the new rc ' s that we have set up since plan has been
complete , so please make sure you have each rc 100 % allocated .
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday
january 19 th , and the updated january 2000 percentages returned to me by end
of day friday january 21 st .
thanks for your help in getting these updated .

chris :
with the $ 1 . 5 million to ship mhi turbines 1 and 2 , the summary of the numbers is the following :
therefore , we would be about $ 300 , 000 over the original dash . these numbers do not include transaction and financing costs . i will do a dash amendment and am copying louise on this email so that she is aware of what is going on . the storeage would be in a bonded warehouse , so no duties would be due at this time . on leads , we have a couple of new parties , but nothing concrete yet . ron has been working with one counterparty and may receive an offer in the near term .

the proposed plan on the mhi units is to ship units 1 and 2 to the us for storeage at a central location . the storeage costs are significantly less than proposed by mhi and the ability to centralize all of the shipments will be beneficial for a potential sale . from an economic perspective , it would be better if we had a sale in the short term and could ship directly . however , given a lack of any firm sale , the recommendation is to ship them to the us and store . let me know if you are in agreement with going forward with the shipment .

i would like to have a meeting today regarding the storage of mhi 501 f units 1 & 2 . we have received a proposal from mhi for these units to be stored in japan which is attached . i believe we have better options if mhi persists in their views on how the unit will be stored and enron is charged for these services . i would like for you to review and offer comments and suggestions . i have also attached the letter i sent to them outlining our requirements .
does anytime from 1 - 3 p work for everyone .

"Subject: update on confirmlogic
i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we
discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we
had found that were "" show stoppers "" as far as releasing the product for beta
testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle
basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for
power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the "" fixes "" and migrated the code last night . today
during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems
with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i
talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we
plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to
introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to
postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were
comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need
consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the "" new "" streamlined version of the screens and feel that
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .
call with any questions .

per the broker statement received this morning the initial margin for mann increased by only $ 6 . 1 mm . it does not appear that they have changed their margin calculation method from this . i have contacted the enron person responsible for confirming the amounts to be settled with mann and instructed her to contact me if mann requests any settlement that differs from the statement received this morning . the preliminary number for mann ' s initial margin and variation margin was a net inflow of $ 4 . 8 mm .

hplc will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producer listed below for the
production month of july . this production will be purchased on a "" spot ""
basis and a deal ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on
the following information :
counterparty meter volume price
cody texas , l . p . 5333 2975 mmbtu / d 100 % if / hsc less $ 0 . 09
this ticket should be marked evergreen , so that it rolls month to month .
additionally , this is a producer svcs . deals and should be tracked in the im
wellhead portfolio . . . attached to the gathering contract .
hillary ,
i noticed deal 305549 has just been put in for one day ( 6 / 1 / 00 ) . we have
flow at this meter during the month of june , so could this ticket be changed
to go through 6 / 30 / 00 ?

"Subject: joe mccauley ' s papers
vince ,
as promised , these are a couple of references that i have for joe mccauley ' s
papers .
whether the specific papers are of interest to what exactly we ' re doing or
not , i cannot say . on the other hand , given uh ' s drive to create an
"" econophysics "" specialization within the physics department , i thought we
could both help them * and * drive it towards a direction that it could be of
use to us . i think that they would very much like to hear what the industry
would like to see from such a specialization . some of the things that have
been discussed as course offerings would be :
basic physics courses ( mechanics , nonlinear dynamics , stat . physics , math
methods )
various finance courses like options , banking , etc .
statistics , math methods , and statistical physics ( that could teach topics
like brownian motion , lognormal distributions , fractals , levy flights , and
statistics of ' large deviations ' , which are of interest
comp science ( java , c + + , data structures , algorithms )
monte carlo simulations
etc
setting up some sort of exchange , where at minimum we could get summer
interns from this program , would also be beneficial to both sides . even
better , a wider collaboration between enron and the physics department could
be set up .
after this message ,
i will inform joe mccauley and larry pinsky ( departmental chair person ) of
your suggestions on how to proceed .
i will send shirley their contact information to arrange for a visit at the
beginning of june .

edison utility rescue - plan session set for oct . 9 by davis
by michael b . marois
sacramento , california , sept . 27 ( bloomberg ) - - a special legislative session to consider a rescue package for edison international ' s insolvent california utility won ' t begin until oct 9 . , aides for governor gray davis said .
the governor had been expected to call lawmakers back oct . 2 . his aides didn ' t explain the reasons for the delay . the governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p . m . san francisco time , davis spokeswoman hilary mclean said .
southern california edison , california ' s second - largest utility , accrued $ 3 . 9 billion in debt under the state ' s deregulation law , which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise . some of the utility ' s creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy . pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric , the state ' s largest utility , filed for bankruptcy in april .
the legislature adjourned sept . 15 without approving a $ 2 . 9 billion rescue package , prompting davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to sacramento to consider a new plan .
the latest edison measure may let the utility sell $ 2 . 5 billion to $ 2 . 9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt , secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers , davis aides said last week .",0

"Subject: virus update : please read
there are many different variations of the "" iloveyou "" computer virus still
being reported . the it infrastructure team is continually updating our virus
software as new versions become available , but it is extremely important that
you do not open any attachments that you do not regularly receive from
business associates . even business associates you are very familiar with
could be sending you the virus without knowing it , so unless you are
expecting an email from them with an specified attachment please do not open
it . if you are unsure whether to open an attachment please do not open it .
call your helpdesk to ask any questions and to get verification if required .
we may need you to log out and log back in during the day as new anti virus
updates become available . we appreciate your cooperation while we all work
to keep enron ' s computing environment secure .
please note the following enron policies regarding viruses :
email
malicious code ( virus ) screening
in addition to the enron requirement for email attachments ( received and
sent ) to be screened for malicious code ( viruses , trojan horses , etc . ) , users
of enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes .
all executables ( * . bat , * exe , * . com , * . vbs ) files should never be launched
from email without first consulting with it .
virus alerts
the internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer
viruses and trojan horses . however , within among real virus notices are
computer virus hoaxes . while these hoaxes do not infect systems , they are
still time consuming and costly to handle . it only wastes bandwidth and
unnecessarily alarms other computer users .
please , do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and trojan
horses . if you receive an invalidated warning , don ' t pass it to all your
friends , pass it to your it computer security manager to validate first .

"Subject: university of texas mccombs school of business
the following memo will be hand delivered to you in hard copy form on tuesday
morning , feb . 20 . we will enclose the pledge form and
an enron matching gifts form for your convenience .
our meeting with bob may , dean of the mccombs school of business at
ut - austin , was a great success . we had 14 attendees who received an update
from bob about the many great things going on in austin , as well as
opportunities to participate in the  & we  , re texas  8 capital campaign .
after bob  , s presentation , the 14 enron officers met separately and were
extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner
to the mccombs school . this was evidenced by an expression of intent in
giving totaling about $ 175 , 000 from just the 14 people !
here is what we propose and how it would work .
1 . the ut alumni at enron would pledge $ 1 million over four years to the
mccombs school . this would consist of $ 500 , 000 of gifts from employees and a
matching $ 500 , 000 from enron .
2 . the matching program provided through the mccombs gift to the business
school would match the $ 1 million .
3 . the result would be a permanently endowed $ 2 million  & enron chair  8 to
support  & star quality  8 faculty for the school . this will represent one of
the largest faculty chairs at the business school .
a few additional details :
1 . each individual  , s contribution will also be credited to their name ( along
with the enron match ) for recognition purposes in business school  , s annual
report , president  , s associates , etc . in other words , a $ 10 , 000 contribution
matched by enron will be considered as a $ 20 , 000 contribution by that
individual for recognition purposes .
2 . enron has agreed to not count it  , s match against an employee  , s annual
matching gift limitation of $ 15 , 000 , as long as the gift is coordinated in a
way that makes it a part of the  & enron chair  8 .
3 . the gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the  however , the leadership of the group will determine our
success .
thanks for your consideration and continuing support of the university of

i got to know you through our foreign trade office in london , on my search for a reliable partner , during my official trip . i ammr jerry musa chairman - audit committee , with the federal ministry of communication ( fmc ) , i headed the audit panel whose assignment was to audit , review and recommend payment for all contracts awarded by administration . in the course of our review , we discovered that the sum of usd 25 million ( twenty - five million ) was floating in the ministry account .
this money emanated from over - invoicing in the contract awarded to a foreign firm , based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust , we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves , hence , i decided to contact you . accordingly , i have consulted and held meetings with some key officials of the federal ministry of finance and central bank of nigeria and we decided to involve a competent partner overseas who could provide facilities for the transfer of the money . all modalities for this transfer have been fully worked out .
we have already secured a preliminary order to effect this payment , we intend to share the money in the following manner : thirty percent for you , sixty percent for us and tenpercent for any miscellaneous expenses .

"Subject: transport model
andy ,
the scale effect in the transport model can be explained .
i use a european option to do the illustration .
i raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount , use the fuel
percentage to adjust the strike .
the net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up .
if the fuel percentage is not very high , the option premium actually
increases with the level , although the
intrinsic value decreases .
if the fuel percentage is very high ( > 8 % ) , then we see a decreasing option
price .
in the transport deal , fuel change is often below 5 % , so you will not see a
decreasing spread option price
when nymex moves up . so i think the transport model still does what it
should do .
zimin
in the following exmaple , i used r = 6 % , vol = 20 % , t = 100 days , see spreadsheet
for details .

increases when nymex add - on increases .

"Subject: re : have we totally lost the plot ?
my two cents . . . .
i viewed the goal of the management committee as three - fold
1 . measure management skill
2 . ensure people with superior mgmt skills are appropriately recognized .
3 . ensure best talent ( however defined ) are retained and have mgmt skills nurtured .
to expand on ( 1 ) , ask the questions :
( a ) what attributes characterize a good manager ? from louise ' s list , i would vote for internal alliances and experience .
( b ) how can these be quantified , if at all ?
to expand on ( 2 ) , identify promotion / other opportunities for such people .
the last powerpoint slide is complementing all the discussions so far , but definite goals for the committee were not clear to me - - - do we need to expand on the points on the slide ( i . e . why enron is ahead of other companies , etc . ) ? will we now focus on meritocracy in general and not so much on management itself ?
thanks ,
vasant

jean and i have had a little meeting following a rather interesting 10 minute conversation i had with senior management in enron . suffice to say we have gone in a different direction and thought that we would float out the following concept for you and then we can get together to discuss next week . the work we did in out last meeting is still live .
essentially we are homing in on the one issue of meritocracy and hoping that we are able to make an impact on the organization in relation to this issue .
let ' s discuss next week .

"Subject: re : big cowboy / gepl actuals for february
please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue .
donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .

just to give you all a heads up . . .
jeff skilling has asked for a revenue number for eol that represents what
enron reports on our financial statements ( including the mark - to - market value
of all of our open positions resulting from eol trading ) . we are
specifically looking for mtm value as of the close of trading on the 15 th and
would like to be able to review the results by mid - afternoon ( houston ) on the
16 th . we will need each desk to calculate their eol - specific mtm value and
consolidate this information at the commodity group level ( ie . u . s . power ,
global liquids , n . american gas , etc . ) and return it to the product control
group ( torrey moorer / carrie southard ) by mid - afternoon on the 16 th ( houston )
in order to combine the information into a report for delivery on the 17 th .
we are primarily interested in the total mtm value of our open eol positions ,
but if it is possible to provide a breakout for the mtm value of eol physical
sales , this would help us break out the revenue numbers . if you have
questions , please contact torrey moorer at x 36218 .

houston - ( dow jones ) - dynegy inc . ( dyn ) terminated its troubled merger agreement with enron corp . ( ene ) , backing away from the deal despite frantic last - minute attempts by both sides to save it .
dynegy wednesday cited enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , convenants and agreements , including the material adverse change provision .
the announcement came after standard & poor ' s cut the beleaguered energy trader ' s debt rating to b - minus , essentially rendering it to junk status .
the downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that enron will be forced to file for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code . that could be a fatal blow for enron , which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive .
standard & poor ' s lowered its long - term rating on enron to b - minus from triple - b - minus , citing fears that dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase of enron .
the collapse of the dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on enron ' s credit profile because of enron ' s limited access to capital at a time when extensive debt restructuring is necessary , s & p said .
"" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this doesn ' t reflect a failure for the energy merchant business , "" dynegy said in announcing its decision .
however , dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are solid , and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added volatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of enron .
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down $ 2 . 91 , or 71 % , to $ 1 . 20 . dynegy , meanwhile , was down $ 4 . 08 , or 10 % , at $ 36 . 81 , also on the big board .
top executives of enron and dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine the two energy - trading companies amid growing signs that enron faced cash - flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business .
talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all - stock transaction after enron ' s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn ' t be as high as originally anticipated . last month dynegy agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
citing a person familiar with the situation , the wall street journal said wednesday that enron ' s board late tuesday had informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered , down more than 50 % from the original offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share .
that latest proposed share - exchange ratio valued enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , or a total of $ 4 . 17 billion . that would compare with the original value of $ 10 . 98 a share , or $ 9 . 33 billion . in exchange for reducing the purchase price , some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company . dynegy also was considering an additional $ 250 million cash investment in enron . dynegy , together with chevrontexaco inc . ( cvx ) , has already injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company .
while struggling to keep the planned merger alive , enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings . enron has a total of about $ 13 billion of debt , of which about $ 9 billion comes due by the end of next year . last month enron said in a filing with the sec that a cut in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain levels - would trigger the need to repay , refinance or cash collateralize facilities totaling $ 3 . 9 billion .
dynegy said wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of enron natural gas pipeline unit northern natural , omaha , neb . , and said it has exercised its right to acquire the unit ' s common shares .
chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , contributed $ 1 . 5 billion to the proposed enron merger , and dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline unit .
northern natural , which owns and operates 16 , 500 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline spanning from the permian basin of texas to the great lakes , has historically been a strong earnings contributor .
dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to dynegy ' s own energy delivery network .

the wall street journal online
blue - chip stocks remained weak wednesday , after a key survey of regional conditions from the federal reserve revealed that many sectors of the economy continued to struggle .
investors also were rattled by news that dynegy had pulled out of merger talks with fellow energy - provider enron .
in midafternoon trading , the dow jones industrial average was down 111 points to 9761 , after flirting with a return to 10000 over the last two sessions . the industrials finished down 110 . 15 points , or 1 . 1 % , at 9872 . 60 tuesday .
meanwhile , the nasdaq composite index lost 27 . 30 to 1908 . 70 , after declining 5 . 26 points to 1935 . 97 tuesday .
other indexes also fell . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index shed 13 . 20 to 1136 . 40 , the russell 2000 index declined 3 to 457 . 70 , and the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 4 . 90 to 579 . 70 .
the fed ' s so - called beige book indicated the economy remained soft in october and november . the survey showed "" signs of further slowing outweighed signs of recovery "" in early november . "" the report rekindled speculation that the fed will reduce interest rates again in an effort to stimulate the economy .
investors already had been in the mood to take some money off the table , a trend that started tuesday after the conference board issued a disappointing report on consumer confidence , and federal reserve gov . laurence meyer said it is likely that u . s . economic output is continuing to shrink .
several other key indicators are due out over the next couple of days , including the commerce department ' s report friday on third - quarter gross domestic product .
investors also were rattled wednesday after standard the european union commission expects the companies to request approval for the merger "" soon . "" shares of compaq fell 2 . 1 % .

energy markets seen surviving enron ' s woes , but changed

new york - ( dow jones ) - the energy markets built by enron corp . ( ene ) will survive the company ' s troubles , but they won ' t emerge unscathed , traders and analysts said wednesday .
energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the houston - based giant ' s creditworthiness , allowing a more or less orderly withdrawal of enron from the market before ratings agencies wednesday downgraded enron ' s credit to junk - bond levels .
nevertheless , liquidity in the north american natural gas and electricity markets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tightened in general , creating difficulties for some energy traders .
"" this doesn ' t spell the end of energy trading , "" said one trading manager for an independent power producer . "" the market is much bigger than enron , and that ' s why enron fell . this does spell the spell the end of trading for companies that don ' t have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or two as credit requirements are generally tightened , ""
moreover , small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their 2002 output with enron earlier this year - when prices were much higher than they are now - will suffer if enron has trouble fulfilling those commitments .
enron warned in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels .
news of enron ' s downgrade added 5 cents to 10 cents to natural gas futures at the new york mercantile exchange , as traders covering short positions sent the december contract to $ 2 . 82 per million british thermal units , traders said .
midwestern and southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due to trading inefficiencies after enron turned off its internet - based trading platform enrononline and higher gas prices .
prices have in all those markets have since fallen , but the moves point to the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders expect should enron exit the market entirely .
kyle cooper , energy analyst at salomon smith barney , said traders will have to present wider bid - offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets in which enron provided critical liquidity .
"" one less player , one less market , because of the illiquidity , "" cooper said .
at one time , enron accounted for about a quarter of all trade in the north american gas and power markets .

uk : enron - a pioneer of europe ' s new power markets .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 28 ( reuters ) - u . s . group enron , on the brink of collapse on wednesday , has been a pioneer of energy dealing in europe and its demise would rob utilities across the continent of a key trading partner .
with a european staff of 5 , 000 , offices in most major cities and a lavish headquarters overlooking london ' s buckingham palace , enron created the trading culture now embraced by previously sceptical european utilities as markets open up to competition .
until recently , enron had accounted for about 30 percent of german wholesale power trading . it was also a major player in uk gas and electricity and nordic power , and was driving forward a fledgling french power market .
"" on average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties , "" enron ' s director of continental power trading gregor baeumerich told reuters in an interview last month , days before the group was plunged into its current crisis .
britain ' s forward gas market rallied on wednesday as it emerged that a rescue deal from smaller rival dynegy had unravelled and enron looked to be skating dangerously close to bankruptcy .
enron ' s list of trading partners included major utilities such as german giants e . on and rwe and the uk ' s innogy and british energy
u . s . companies with trading desk in europe , such as txu , aep , dynegy and duke energy , also traded with enron .
the company ' s enrononline internet trading platform , suspended earlier on wednesday , set the standard for online trading , offering a blueprint followed by utilities and brokers .
enron did about 60 percent of its trade through the platform .
the group ' s presence in europe is not confined to trading . the company has around 4 , 000 megawatts of power generation , spanning italy , poland , greece and the uk where it owns one of the biggest plants at teesside .
the company built a reputation for hard - nosed trading expertise in europe ' s previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost evangelical .
in the summer , flushed with confidence , the company placed a bmw sports car in the lobby of its london office , a prize for employees successful in recruiting fresh talent for the enron cause .

usa : wrapup 2 - enron near collapse after dynegy pulls out .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp . swooned at the edge of one of the biggest corporate collapses in u . s . history on wednesday as its rescue by rival dynegy inc . blew apart .
dynegy accused enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeover agreement was negotiated on nov . 9 , invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the all - stock deal valued at $ 9 . 3 billion at the time .
shares of enron , recently ranked no . 7 on the fortune 500 list of the biggest u . s . companies , had lost most of their value in the past three weeks , and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on enron ' s bonds to junk status by the time dynegy made its announcement .
enron ' s latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free - fall that began innocently enough with the announcement of a $ 638 million quarterly loss six weeks ago . surprise disclosures , including the admission it overstated earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 and kept huge debts off its balance sheet , led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almost $ 80 billion a little more than a year ago .
on wednesday , its market value was less than $ 500 million .
in response to dynegy ' s announcements and credit rating downgrades , enron said it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core operations .
kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said the company was evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesses .
the loss of enron ' s investment - grade credit rating forces some $ 3 . 9 billion in debts to come due immediately , a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $ 5 . 5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat . enron said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to "" continue as a going concern "" were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status .
it became increasingly clear , as dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal , that enron ' s tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a sticking point , sources close to the negotiations said .
"" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business , "" dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in a statement .
dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline with the $ 1 . 5 billion it and partner chevrontexaco put into the deal .
dynegy said it stopped trading with enron as of wednesday morning , pegging its exposure at $ 75 million .
a bad sign came earlier on wednesday , as energy traders said operations had stopped at enron ' s once highly lucrative online trading system , enrononline . the unit accounted for up to 90 percent of enron ' s earnings , and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that dynegy coveted most in its planned $ 9 . 3 billion all - stock takeover .

enron , which touted itself as an agile risk manager , found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks .
the partnerships , which included top enron executives and are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation , provided financing in exchange for guarantees that enron ' s stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment - grade . but they came back onto the balance sheet with a vengeance , as enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations as its shares and credit fell .
enron shares plunged $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , to 61 cents on wednesday , as the new york stock exchange twice halted trading of enron shares before announcements affecting the company . it ' s stock has fallen more than 98 percent this year .
the stock peaked at $ 90 . 56 in august 2000 , riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena .
"" they ( enron ) entrapped the sophisticates , "" said robert stovall , senior strategist at prudential securities , referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for enron by institutional investors . "" i think this is going to become a classic case . ""
stovall , with nearly 50 years of wall street experience , said he could not recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of enron .
"" you would have to go to pre - sec days for that , "" he said , referring to the creation of the sec in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 .
the final cuts
standard & poor ' s , moody ' s investors service and fitch all cut their ratings on the fallen energy trading giant ' s debt to junk status . s & p said it had lost confidence in enron ' s ability to complete the merger with dynegy , and said bankruptcy was a "" distinct possibility "" if the merger fails .
andre meade , a commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on enron and the deal , said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace in recent weeks , and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they wanted inside enron .
"" the numbers were not enough to soothe them , "" said meade , who downgraded enron to "" sell "" from "" hold "" on wednesday . "" this company should have been downgraded to junk weeks ago . the ratings agencies had given them several weeks , and they just couldn ' t hold out anymore . ""
dynegy on nov . 9 said it would take over enron in a deal valued at about $ 10 . 41 per enron share . chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , pledged to immediately pump $ 1 . 5 billion into enron to bolster its withering finances .
deal advisers j . p . morgan chase and citigroup have already contributed $ 1 billion to the deal , and were expected to have to put up after enron was rebuffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash .
representatives of dynegy and enron had haggled over new terms for the takeover late into tuesday , including a buyout offer half the original price , sources close to the talks said .
enron ' s crash began when it said it would take $ 1 . 01 billion in writedowns and charges against its third - quarter earnings for failed investments . it later admitted that it had to reduce stockholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion to extract itself from partnerships in which now - ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow the managing partner .
those deals , in which fastow earned about $ 30 million in management fees , are the subject of an sec investigation and the . worse yet for enron , it was required to restate its earnings going back four years , shaving off $ 600 million in the process .

new york , nov 28 ( reuters ) - enron corp ' s internet - based energy and metals trading system was shut down on wednesday , shortly after a leading credit - rating agency downgraded the company ' s debt to "" junk "" status , energy traders said .
it was not clear whether the enrononline trading system was halted deliberately or by a technical problem . enron officials were not immediately available for comment .
"" we were watching the board and suddenly it went blank , "" said one northeast natural gas trader . activity on enrononline was halted just after 11 a . m . ( 1600 gmt ) , the trader said .
energy traders said the standard & poor ' s announcement that it was downgrading enron debt triggered a brief spike in new york mercantile exchange natural gas futures , to $ 2 . 82 per million btu , but prices later slipped to the low - $ 2 . 70 s , still up more than 11 cents from tuesday .
"" we spiked on the enron news . people ran in to cover any exposure because of the uncertainty . i think they ' re expecting the company to file for chapter 11 ( bankruptcy ) , "" said one midwest gas and power trader .
"" the enron ( stock ) halt sent a shock through the ( power ) market and all trading stopped . the enron guys pulled all their numbers ( on enrononline ) , "" another trader at a houston - based energy firm said .
u . s . natural gas and electricity firms have been steadily scaling back deals with enron for several weeks as fears mounted about the former energy giant ' s credit standing .
"" people have been balancing their risk exposure over the last few weeks , "" another midwest trader said .
enron was by far the largest u . s . natural gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some 20 percent of daily trade in those markets .
but since last month , when the company became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of financial dealings with partnerships , the houston - based company ' s market share has steadily eroded .
enrononline until recently accounted for about 60 percent of the daily trade volume handled by enron .
enron shares were briefly halted on the new york stock exchange this morning following the credit - rating downgrade . after the stock reopened , it dropped $ 2 . 84 to $ 1 . 30 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares closed tuesday at $ 4 . 14 .

washington , nov 28 ( reuters ) - the chairman of the u . s . house energy and commerce committee said on wednesday he could not see how the government could come to the rescue of enron corp . , near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
"" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , "" said billy tauzin , republican of louisiana .
but he said the government must watch carefully whether the troubles of the houston - based enron - once ranked as the nation ' s largest trader of electricity and natural gas - had implications for u . s . energy supplies and pricing .
tauzin noted that enron had been a "" very big contributor "" to energy supplies in california , which was rocked last winter by a tenfold jump in wholesale electricity prices , a string of black - outs and the bankruptcy of the state ' s largest utility .
"" we ' ve got to watch that very carefully , obviously . we don ' t want to be in another session next year trying to deal with energy problems in california as a result of some of the events that are occurring right now with enron , "" tauzin said .
the underlying cause of california ' s problems last winter was widely seen as the state ' s badly written electricity deregulation law , which did not allow power companies to pass through higher wholesale electricity costs to consumers .
tauzin said enron ' s decline was unfortunate . "" it ' s a sad story . it ' s been a hugely successful enterprise . ""
"" i would hope they could work it out . we can ' t simply step into every bad market decision and every bad financing decision that occurs in american corporations in this country and work it out for them . we have to count on them to figure it out themselves . ""
"" our job is going to be to make sure in policy we haven ' t left a breach open where consumers are going to end up short or overpriced in the process , "" he added .
enron ' s financial problems have steadily unravelled since last month , when it became the target of a securities and exchange commission investigation of some enron partnerships .
on wednesday , dynergy said it called off its plan to buy enron in a $ 9 billion stock deal , citing breaches in the merger agreement . the company ' s credit ratings were downgraded to junk status .

san francisco , nov 28 ( reuters ) - nymex hub gas , up midday wednesday on enron corp . ' s financial troubles , tumbled late after bearish aga data was released this afternoon , traders said .
"" healthy supplies continue to be confirmed week after week with these aga reports . until we see a guy in chicago with ice coming off his nose we will go lower because supplies are abundant and there ' s no demand , "" one northeast trader said .
the trader said front - month nymex prices could fall below $ 2 per mmbtu in the days ahead if widespread and sustainable cold weather failed to materialize .
at 2 : 48 p . m . est , december was down 40 . 6 cents at $ 2 . 20 per million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) after aga data was released .
earlier in the session , december , which expires today , rocketed to $ 2 . 82 after standard & poor ' s cut energy trading giant enron ' s debt to junk status , a move that threw into question the company ' s ability to meet its financial obligations .
enron is by far the largest u . s . gas and electricity trader , with industry analysts estimating it was once involved in some 20 percent of daily trade in those markets .
aga storage data released this afternoon showed u . s . gas stocks for the week ended nov . 23 rose by 12 bcf , well above reuters survey estimates for an unchanged - to 5 bcf withdrawal number , the year - ago slide of 146 bcf and the five - year average pull of 66 bcf .
total inventories of 3 . 144 tcf jumped to 642 bcf , or 26 percent , above last year and 391 bcf above the five year average .
last week , storage , which stands at 95 percent full , broke the all - time record high of 3 . 127 tcf hit on nov . 6 , 1998 .
most analysts expect the gas glut to grow further in coming weeks , noting last year more than 1 tcf was drawn from inventory during a record cold november - december period .
eastern stocks were unchanged at 98 percent of capacity , about 15 percent above last year . consuming region west storage , which rose 3 bcf for the week , was 46 percent above year - ago levels . inventories in the producing region gained 13 bcf and stood 41 percent above 2000 levels .
the national weather service 6 - 10 day forecast , released late tuesday , called for above normal temperatures for the eastern two - thirds of the nation , with seasonal or below seasonal readings expected in the west .
chart traders said the technical picture remained bearish , particularly with cash still more than 70 cents below the screen , and most said they needed a december close below the november low of $ 2 . 482 to signal another leg lower .
below $ 2 . 482 , december support was pegged at the contract low of $ 2 . 415 and then in the $ 2 . 14 area and at $ 2 . 00 .
december resistance was seen first in the $ 3 . 00 area and then at the $ 3 . 15 - 3 . 208 gap and the high from four weeks ago of $ 3 . 44 .
in the cash today , henry hub swing quotes fell on average 43 cents to $ 2 . 30 . most cash dealers pinned the steep rise to cooler weather and uncertainty over enron ' s future .
midwest pipes jumped 20 to 30 cents to the $ 2 . 50 area . in the west , gas at waha hub in west texas was around 20 cents higher in the mid - $ 2 . 50 s .
swing gas on transco at the new york city gate soared about 60 cents to $ 2 . 72 , while chicago was almost 30 cents higher at $ 2 . 49 .
nymex said an estimated 33 , 265 henry hub contracts traded at 11 : 05 a . m . est .
nymex has been holding abbreviated floor trading sessions following the sept . 11 attacks on the world trade center .
nymex gas open outcry trade will run from 10 : 00 a . m . to 2 : 30 p . m . , with the internet - based access session held from 3 : 15 p . m . to 9 : 00 a . m . , through dec . 31 .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones less than a year ago , they were trading at $ 84 . 87 . dynegy shares were off $ 4 . 08 , or 10 percent , to $ 36 . 81 .
in a statement , dynegy said enron had breached its acquisition agreement , triggering a "" material adverse "" clause and causing it to call of the deal .
"" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business , "" said dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson .
the dynegy move came after standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service both cited a loss of confidence that the deal will be consummated , and said that dynegy ' s willingness to go through with the buyout has been compromised by continued erosion in investor confidence and enron ' s core energy trading business .
the downgrades make $ 3 . 9 billion of enron debt due immediately , and up to $ 16 billion in other debt originally due next year could come due earlier .
in its statement , dynegy also said it would exercise its right to purchase enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline , an option it received after it and chevrontexaco - which holds a 26 percent stake in dynegy - pumped $ 1 . 5 million into the ailing enron .
despite dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline , analysts are anticipating a battle over enron ' s assets in bankruptcy court .
"" it ' s going to be a fight "" between dynegy and enron ' s creditors , howald said .
spokesmen for both enron and dynegy didn ' t immediately return repeated calls seeking comment wednesday , though dynegy scheduled a conference call for later in the afternoon .
enron and dynegy , both based in houston , had spent the last several days trying to hammer out a revision to their nov . 9 merger agreement , which valued enron stock at more than $ 10 per share .
"" this comes in response to the fact that they weren ' t able to craft a deal last night . they were working on getting more cash ( from banks shepherding the merger ) last night , but they didn ' t get it , "" said a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim said . "" i think bankruptcy ' s not too far away . ""
raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright predicted dynegy will survive with a few battle scars .
"" i believe we all misunderstood how dramatic a credibility crisis can be in a recession in a bear market , "" he said . "" the speed at which enron collapsed caught us all off guard . ""
enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allowed the company to keep about half a billion in debt off its books and allowed the executives to profit from the arrangements . enron ' s dealings with those partnerships are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
the company ousted its top financial officer in october , and several weeks ago restated its earnings back to 1997 - eliminating more than $ 580 million in reported income .

dynegy pull out of enron purchase ; credit ratings cut ( update 6 )
( updates to add dynegy comment ; share price . )
new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . abandoned its
proposed purchase of enron corp . , said dynegy in a press
statement . the decision threatens to force enron , once the
country ' s largest energy trader , into bankruptcy .
standard & poor ' s corp . cut enron ' s credit rating to junk as
bankers failed to raise $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until
the deal was completed . the lack of funds and the prospect of a
downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision to scrap the
acquisition , which was valued at $ 23 billion on nov . 9 .
enron shares fell as much as 71 percent to $ 1 . 20 , its lowest
level in at least 19 years . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which
mature in 2006 , were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar , down from
53 yesterday . at that price the bonds yield 57 percent .
` ` the reality is enron ' s going bankrupt , ' ' said michael
willingham , a risk manager at itochu international inc . ` ` enron
touted themselves as the king of risk management , but it doesn ' t
look like they ' ve managed their risk very well . ' '
bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
lee tried for for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed .
investors including saudi prince alwaleed bin talal , the
blackstone group lp and the carlyle group inc . turned them down
because of concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . that
concern was heightened after enron disclosed a previously
undisclosed $ 690 million interest payment due this week .
dynegy said in a statement distributed by business wire that
it terminated its agreement because enron breached covenants .
chairman and ceo chuck watson said dynegy would invoke its right
to purchase enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline . dynegy used an
investment of $ 1 . 5 billion from chevrontexaco corp . , which owns
one quarter of dynegy , to purchase the enron unit , which operates
16 , 500 miles of natural gas pipeline .
enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls for
comment .
trading doubts
enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading
partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay
bills . as a result , they either demanded more collateral to trade
or restricting trading with the houston - based company .
enrononline , enron corp . ' s online trading system , stopped
allowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas
late this morning , say traders who use the web site . enron said
yesterday that enrononline handles about 60 percent of its trading
business , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in trading on average over
the last 30 days .
` ` we can log in , but there is nothing there , nothing to buy
and nothing to sell , ' ' said juha laiho , an energy trader at
finland - based fortum oyj in houston . ` ` it went down some time
this morning . ' '
s in both 1998
and 1999 , it had been less than a majority .
participants in the plan , which had $ 2 . 14 billion in assets
available for benefits , could only do so much to diversify their
investments . enron , like many other companies , used stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of
the shares .
and they could only guess at the year - end makeup of the plan ' s
assets until the end of june , reflecting sec disclosure standards
for savings plans . by that time , the stock ' s drop - - which reached
99 percent today - - was already well under way .
trio of lawsuits
enron later reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter charges ;
ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran partnerships
that accounted for some of the charges ; restated its results since
1997 ; became the target of an sec accounting investigation ; and
accepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc . , its biggest rival .
the company ' s shares , which ended last year at $ 83 . 13 , fell as
low as $ 1 . 05 today before a midday trading halt as enron ' s debt was
downgraded to junk - bond status and dynegy abandoned its offer .
in response to the plunge , employees in the 401 ( k ) plan - -
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax - free
savings , and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue
service code - - have filed three lawsuits against enron .
the suits allege , among other things , that the houston - based
company prevented employees from shifting investments within the
plan between oct . 17 , the day after its disclosure of the charges ,
and nov . 19 as the company made administrative changes .
all three seek class - action status on behalf of the plan ' s
participants . the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener law
firm , based in washington , on monday . it covers the longest time
period : november 1995 to now .
falling percentages
enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan ' s
assets at the end of 1994 , the year before the period associated
with the gottesdiner suit began . the figure reflected a one - time
company contribution of preferred stock , and rose from 62 percent
in 1993 .
each preferred share has a face value of $ 100 and is
convertible into 27 . 304 common shares . this translates into a
conversion price of $ 3 . 66 a share , which was a bargain before
today ' s trading .
the plan also owned a stake in enron ' s former oil and gas
unit , which became eog resources inc . after gaining independence in
1999 . add in those shares , and company stock represented about two -
thirds of the 1994 assets .
enron ' s common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of
401 ( k ) assets available for benefits in 1995 , 58 percent in 1996
and 53 percent in 1997 as the u . s . stock market rallied , lifting
the value of participants ' investments in equity mutual funds .
the shares represented 49 percent of the plan ' s assets in
1998 . the proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999 , when the
assets more than doubled - - exceeding the 56 percent increase in
enron ' s share price that year - - to $ 1 . 62 billion .
how much choice ?
then came last year , when the common shares recorded their
best performance in more than two decades even as u . s . stocks
stumbled . enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and
natural gas prices , while the standard & poor ' s 500 index , a market
benchmark that includes the company , fell 10 percent .
company shares in the plan rose in value by $ 652 . 7 million ,
according to an sec filing . the total includes shares bought and
sold throughout the year . by contrast , mutual - fund holdings fell by
$ 47 million and ` ` other investments ' ' rose by just $ 134 , 000 , the
filing said .
at year - end , the 401 ( k ) plan owned 13 . 9 million enron common
shares and 70 , 000 preferred shares , valued at $ 1 . 32 billion . this
total encompasses not only enron ' s matching contributions to the
plan , but also employees ' investments with their own money .
the company generally provides a 50 percent match , in stock ,
for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan . employees
can ' t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment
choices until they reach the age of 50 .
company contributions accounted for about 11 percent of the
plan ' s stock holdings , said karen denne , an enron spokeswoman . the
figure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company
than usual for 401 ( k ) participants .
waiting for data
for the average u . s . plan account , company stock amounted to
19 percent of assets at the end of last year , according to a study
done by the employee benefit research institute and the investment
company institute and published last week .
in any case , enron ' s approach to matching ensures that as much
as one - third of the contribution to an employee ' s account takes the
form of shares that they can ' t sell right away .
anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach , and enron ' s
stock performance , affected the plan ' s financial position last year
had to wait until june 27 . that ' s when the filing cited earlier
arrived at the sec .
employee savings and stock - purchase plans , such as 401 ( k )
plans , don ' t have to submit annual reports until 180 days after
their fiscal year ends . they can even get a 15 - day extension of the
deadline if they need one .
by the time enron ' s plan made its annual report , it was
already a bit too late to act on the information . the company ' s
shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of
the submission . as the filing demonstrated , employees looking to
save for retirement had been set up for a fall .
enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 )
2001 - 11 - 28 14 : 38 ( new york )
enron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 )
( updates with analyst comment in third paragraph , fitch
rating in fourth paragraph and shares in sixth paragraph . )
new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - standard & poor ' s , moody ' s
investors service and fitch , inc . slashed enron corp . ' s credit
rating to junk status as rival energy trader dynegy inc . rescinded
its buyout bid for the company .
the cut could force enron into bankruptcy . at least $ 3 . 9
billion in debt comes due immediately because of the rating cut ,
and the company struggles with a cash crunch as it suspends its
online trading unit and some ` ` non - core ' ' payments . enron ' s
trading business is also faltering as trading partners lose faith
in the company ' s ability to meet its obligations .
` ` this is a disaster , ' ' said jon kyle cartwright , a debt
analyst at raymond james and associates . ` ` it is difficult , if not
impossible , for anyone to do trades with enron ' s trading
operations in light of junk ratings across the board and dynegy
walking away from the deal . ' '
s & p reduced enron ' s long - term grade six levels to ` ` b - ' ' from
` ` bbb - ' ' and withdrew its ` ` a ' ' short - term rating . moody ' s cut
enron ' s credit rating to ` ` b 2 , ' ' five levels below investment
grade , from ` ` baa 3 , ' ' the lowest investment level . moody ' s
affirmed its ` ` not - prime ' ' rating on enron ' s commercial paper .
fitch cut enron ' s senior unsecured rating 10 levels , to
` ` cc ' ' from ` ` bbb - , ' ' and its short term rating to its second -
lowest ` ` c ' ' from ` ` f 3 . ' ' fitch said a ` ` default of some kind
appears probable . ' '
deterioration
` ` we saw the deterioration in the trading operations , and
that threw the merger in doubt , ' ' said s & p analyst todd shipman
and the author of the report .
enron has $ 15 . 5 billion of debt outstanding , according to
bloomberg data . its shares , which have fallen 99 . 2 percent so far
this year , lost $ 3 . 34 cents today and are now trading at 77 cents .
enron ' s stock had fallen by more than 50 percent since nov .
19 amid growing skepticism that the dynegy would complete the
acquisition .
` ` we became a lot more concerned when the stock didn ' t
stabilize , ' ' said john diaz , moody ' s managing director for energy
and one of the authors of the report . ` ` the drop in the stock
price put pressure on dynegy to renegotiate the deal . ' '
cash burn
shipman said in his report that ` ` the willingness of dynegy
to complete its planned acquisition of enron has been compromised
by the continued drop in confidence in the capital markets that
the transaction would hold . ' '
credit analysts also focused on enron ' s ` ` cash burn ' ' rate ,
diaz said . enron said in its most recent filing last week that it
had $ 1 billion in cash , which was a lot less than the market had
expected , diaz said .
` ` it came as a surprise to us and to others , ' ' he said . ` ` we
expected at least $ 2 . 5 billion so they would have staying power . ' '
enron expected to sell portland utility to northwest natural
2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 07 ( new york )
enron expected to sell portland utility to northwest natural
portland , oregon , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the
nearly bankrupt energy trader , is expected to go through with the
sale of its portland general electric co . unit to northwest
natural gas co . , a spokesman for the utility owner said .
enron last month agreed to sell pge to northwest natural for
$ 2 . 9 billion in cash , stock and assumed debt . dynegy inc . today
called off its planned purchase of enron , saying the energy trader
breached covenants in the merger agreement . dynegy had supported
the pge sale .
northwest natural filed its application to buy pge with the
oregon public utility commission today . enron representatives have
given the portland , oregon - based company no indication that they
plan to call off the sale , northwest natural spokesman steve
sechrist said .
` ` we think the transaction will be completed , ' ' sechrist
said . ` ` whatever happens to enron , the deal has significant
benefits for customers and shareholders of both their company and
our company . ' '
a spokeswoman for houston - based enron didn ' t return calls for
comment . pge spokesman scott simms said he couldn ' t comment on
enron ' s planned sale of the utility .
northwest natural shares fell 32 cents to $ 24 . 02 in
midafternoon trading . enron shares fell $ 2 . 91 to $ 1 . 20 before
trading was halted for dynegy ' s announcement . enron shares have
dropped 99 percent since the first of the year .
commission ' s role
marc hellman , the administrator responsible for mergers and
acquisitions at the oregon public utility commission , said he is
unsure what would happen if enron were to file for bankruptcy
protection .
` ` i can ' t recall it ever happening , and i ' ve been here for
22 years , ' ' hellman said . ` ` if it went all the way to the end ,
where they ' re liquidating assets , you can ' t sell utility property
without commission approval . there are probably some issues where
our attorney general ' s office may look into it . ' '
hellman said he has heard nothing to indicate northwest
natural ' s purchase of pge wouldn ' t go forward .
` ` enron was getting cash from northwest natural for the
purchase , as well as shares , ' ' hellman said . ` ` that aspect of the
transaction becomes a little curious if enron is going through
bankruptcy . ' '
debt downgrades
moody ' s investors service today downgraded pge ' s senior
secured debt to a 3 from a 2 . moody ' s also downgraded pge ' s
unsecured debt , its junior subordinated debt and its preferred
stock .
the ratings service said it had expected to downgrade pge ' s
ratings once northwest natural completed its acquisition of the
utility .
` ` however , today ' s rating action is being taken in advance of
the expected closing of that transaction to reflect moody ' s
concerns surrounding portland general ' s ability to remain fully
insulated from the many financial challenges currently being faced
by its parent , enron corp . , due in large part to lost investor
confidence in enron , ' ' moody ' s said in a statement .
sempra energy interested in buying some enron assets ( update 2 )
2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 39 ( new york )
sempra energy interested in buying some enron assets ( update 2 )
( adds enron comment in sixth paragraph , updates shares in
fourth . )
san diego , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - sempra energy , an owner of
electric and natural - gas utilities , is interested in buying some
of enron corp . ' s assets now that the energy trader ' s planned
merger with dynegy inc . has failed , a sempra spokesman said .
` ` we are interested in some of enron ' s hard assets and our
interest would lie in those assets that would have synergies with
our own operations , ' ' sempra spokesman doug kline said . ` ` beyond
that i couldn ' t give you more specifics . ' '
dynegy today called off its purchase of enron , saying the
energy trader breached covenants in the merger agreement . dynegy
had agreed to buy enron for at least $ 23 billion in stock and
assumed debt this month . a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities at enron had limited its ability to finance
operations and sent its shares plunging .
sempra shares fell 39 cents to $ 22 . 66 in late trading . enron
shares fell $ 3 . 48 to 63 cents once they resumed trading after a
halt for dynegy ' s announcement . enron shares have dropped
99 percent since the first of the year .
houston - based enron has an ownership interest in argentina ' s
4 , 104 - mile natural - gas pipeline system , the largest pipeline
system in south america . sempra energy international owns a
43 percent stake in two natural - gas utility holding companies in
argentina . sempra also is the owner of the san diego gas &
electric and southern california gas co . utilities .
` ` we are looking at selling our global assets that are not
core to our business , and so we ' ll be continuing with an asset -
sale program , ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne said . ` ` we are not
going to comment on who we ' ve had discussions with or what the
status of those is . ' '
in addition to its interest in enron assets , sempra has had
discussions with enron employees who want to leave the company ,
kline said .
` ` a number of enron employees have approached us , as we ' re
aware they ' ve approached other firms , ' ' kline said .
enron office tower project in limbo after dynegy ends purchase
2001 - 11 - 28 15 : 42 ( new york )
enron office tower project in limbo after dynegy ends purchase
houston , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s 1 . 17 - million -
square - foot office tower project in downtown houston has been
thrown into limbo after dynegy inc . abandoned its proposed
purchase of the country ' s largest energy trader .
the 40 - story tower at 1500 louisiana , next to enron ' s
current headquarters , is scheduled to be completed in january ,
according to hines interests , the construction manager .
the building , the first new houston skyscraper since 1987 ,
features floors as large as 52 , 00 square feet to accommodate
enron ' s trading activities and a circular sky bridge nicknamed
` ` the saturn ring ' ' that connects the new tower with enron ' s
existing building and a parking garage .
` ` dynegy occupies 700 , 000 square feet in houston and the
thinking was that after they bought enron they would move their
operations into the new tower , ' ' said will penland , senior
managing director at property broker cb richard ellis ' s houston
office . ` ` i guess that has fallen by the wayside now . ' '
enron ' s shares tumbled $ 3 . 42 to 69 cents in late trading as
investors and analysts said the company may be forced into
bankruptcy . standard & poor ' s corp . cut enron ' s credit rating to
junk as bankers failed to raise $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to
operate until the deal was completed . enron said it is suspending
all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core
operations .
the cesar pelli & associates - designed tower , called enron
center south , is clad in reflective glass and metal panels , and
features sun shades on its south face , according to hines . the
building ' s seven - story base includes five 52 , 000 square - foot
floors . each of the top 33 stories is 25 , 000 square feet .
when the project was announced two years ago , enron needed
more space to house a growing workforce . its stock price hit a
peak of $ 90 a share in august 2000 .
the project kicked off a building boom for houston , with
three other buildings now under construction that would add 2 . 05
million square feet to the city ' s office supply , according to
prudential financial . the largest of these is a reliant resources
project at 100 main street .
this activity , combined with falling energy prices and job
cuts at compaq computer corp . , continental airlines inc . , and
other houston employers , may cause the city ' s downtown office
vacancy rate to rise to the ` ` mid - teens ' ' in 2002 from 8 . 2
percent at the end of september , according to james sullivan ,
prudential ' s real estate analyst .",0

"Subject: spanish power option pricing
hi paul / cassim ,
further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options , that we may use to
capture short - term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or
broken , i have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the
value .
arbitrary distribution
the first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average
of the q 2 - q 3 swap into a volatility equivalent . this is achieved by fitting
a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard
deviation . the graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed
yesterday . in this example , the annualised volatility is coming up as
approximately 23 % .
pricing & implied volatility
the pricing is as for a regular asian option . the payoff depends on the
average of the daily prices for spanish power for q 2 and q 3 . the valuation
using 23 % volatility is showing about 15 . 3 pta per kwh .
i will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward .
regards ,
anjam

"Subject: hello friend
from mr . michael siisi ,
greetings to you ,
before i introduce myself , i wish to inform you that this letter is not
a hoax mail and i urge you to treat it serious . this letter must come to
you as a big surprise , but i believe it is only a day that people meet and
become great friends and business partners . my name is mr . michael siisi ,
the present branch manager of a bank here in ghana . i write you this proposal
in good faith , believing that i can trust you with the information i am
about to reveal to you . like i said , i have a transaction that will benefit
both of us , as your assistance is required as a foreigner .
i use to head the accounts department in my bank head office , but last december
i was asked to take position of a manager of our branch in kumasi who passed
on , so that was how i became the present manager and discovered a fortune .
as i resumed duty , i discovered an account with total sum of $ 12 , 500 , 000
million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years . from my investigation ,
i found out that this account belongs to one late mr . morris thompson an
american great industrialist and a resident of alaska , who unfortunately
lost his life in the plane crash of alaska airlines flight 261 which crashed
on january 31 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you shall read
more news about the crash on visiting this site which i got during my investigation ;
http : / / www . cnn . com / 2000 / us / 02 / 01 / alaska . airlines . list / and http : / / www . nativefederation . org / history / people / mthompson . html
the account is escrow call account , a secret type of account in my bank
and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it ,
the account has no other beneficiary . i have kept a close monitoring of
the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money
as next of kin to the late mr . morris thompson , meaning that no one is aware
of the account . i cannot directly take out this money without the help
of a foreigner and that is why i am contacting you for an assistance to
claim the funds and share it with me . as the manager of my bank branch ,
i have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner
that comes up as the next of kin to the account , with the correct information
concerning the account , which i shall give you .
i am seeking your co - operation to present you as the next of kin to the
account , so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you . there
is practically no risk involved , the transaction will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law .
if you accept to work with me , i want you to state how you wish us to share
the funds in percentage , so that both parties will be satisfied . contact
me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together ,
so we can go over the details . thanking you in advance and may god bless
you . please , treat with utmost confidentiality . i wait your urgent response .
you can as well contact me by fax , + 233 27621073 and my phone number is
+ 233208216645 .
regards ,
mr . michael siisi .

subject : london status report
hi mike ,
before we meet with vince tomorrow - i thought we should drop you a line and
give you an idea as to what ' s been accomplished in the first week as well as
some of the challenges and problems we ' ve run into . this way we can make the
most effective use of vince ' s time .
1 ) current products and customers
in our first 3 days - we established 6 different customer groups -
representing approximately 40 traders plus additional fundamentals and
analytics folks . the groups are : uk trading , gas fundamentals , crude
trading , weather derivatives , continental power , and an internal trader
newsletter .
we ' ve built the following framework to address these customers - the key
deadlines are noted :
0800 : uk trading / weather derivatives / fundamentals : prepare a 1 to 5 day uk
specific forecast and assess the 12 z runs of the ecmwf ( and ensembles ) , the
avn as well as earthsat ' s 1 - 5 day outlook . the traders are particularly
interested in the performance of the ecmwf as it feeds all of their demand
models . we prepare a 1 page summary and give an idea as to any particular
forecast biases - whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than
the model . we brief the traders and field questions then provide our report
to the fundamentals group .
* * in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and
mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand
models or at least be able to give them our "" best pick "" of guidance and how
we feel things may deviate from that pick .
1030 am : obtain the uk met 6 - 10 and 1 - 5 day forecasts . provide comment for
uk trading .
1200 : uk trading / crude and products / weather derivatives : prepare a full
qualitative analysis of oz models ( mrf / nogaps / canadian / ensembles ) . produce a
6 to 10 day europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the 1 to 5 day
forecast . produce the global weather report including a global executive
summary ; analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6
to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for
european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally
a "" port status report "" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide
ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz
models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day
forecast for uk trading .
1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston .
1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes
to traders .
weekly : produce a weather article for "" critical mass "" - internal trading
newsletter .
of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for
support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive
summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast .
2 ) requested projects :
* gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their
morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective
output from as many forecast models as we can get .
* weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal
outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about
creating a tradeable "" nao index "" and developing an in - house model for
forecasting nao .
* continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for
power generation and hydro .
* gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and
crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for
temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow .
* the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data
across spain for temperature and precipitation .
3 ) leads to follow up on :
* elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let
them know once we were up and running .
* contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support
for crude and products .
* follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power
4 ) challenges :
* we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might
entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that
have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office
functions on a "" hot desk "" system where people are constantly moving around .
this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very
difficult for our customers to identify us .
* administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling
reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually
preparing the reports !
- - -
mike ,
ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of
feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note
i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems
that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned
departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role
through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is
my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in
london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project .
hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few
days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and
vince tomorrow .",0
"Subject: re : how is our allegheny deal ?
great news on the $ - cash is king .
our toll on the other hand has been painful . as of this morning , the remaining business issues were limited to the following :
gross negligence : we have been unwilling to say that if the plant operator is grossly negligent , we will compensate them for their market damages . in general , legal says that the law is vague and haedicke does not want to set a precedent on these types of deals . basically , we have said if the plant is not available allegheny reduces the capacity payment pro - rata . the example used is : the operator has a pick - up baseball game in the plant yard - foul ball is hit into the generator - plant goes down for a month - we say sorry , dont pay us this month - allegheny says pay ld ' s . we both agree that it is not gross negligence if the operator drops a wrench and the plant goes down for a month - allegheny wants a bigger penalty so we proposed a larger discount in the capacity payment .
l / c - in the event we portfolio finance , they want a $ 25 mm l / c to cover willful breach , gross negligence , etc . they want it from a aa bank with $ 2 billion of net worth , we want flexibility with a and smaller net worth - not a dealbreaker .
qualified entity : we want the right to assign the equity without their consent to certain qualified entities ( large power companies ) . we want to be able to sell to a company with min net worth of $ 200 mm , 500 mw of operations and at least one 150 mw + sized plant . allegheny wants a tougher standard - not a dealbeaker
loan agreements : they want copies of the loan agreements that would finance this asset - no .
all of this is very manageable and should be executable tonight . however , each day this week we have been in this position and they have re - introduced new issues / comments which have resulted in negotiations till 4 : 00 - 5 : 00 am .
one additional delay is that we just received very detailed comments from finance . we are going through them right now with brian kerrigan .
overall , i think we will get there , but it may not be until next week .

andersen ' s enron audit prompts tighter ` peer review ' of quality
2001 - 11 - 30 17 : 27 ( new york )
andersen ' s enron audit prompts tighter ` peer review ' of quality
washington , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s accounting
firm , arthur andersen llp , will undergo tougher scrutiny in the
` ` peer review ' ' process in which u . s . audit firms police one
another ' s quality - control standards .
andersen , the fifth - largest accounting firm , said it asked
its peer reviewer , deloitte & touche llp , for the additional
scrutiny in light of financial reporting issues at enron ,
according to an andersen press release . deloitte & touche had
independently determined that it wanted to conduct additional
procedures , the release said .
` ` in light of recent developments , we believe that extending
the peer review to include work done in other offices , including
houston , and other procedures that deloitte & touche deems
appropriate and necessary is the right thing to do , ' ' andersen
chief executive joseph berardino said in the release .
the peer review is due on dec . 31 . andersen ' s last review by
deloitte & touche , the third - largest accounting and consulting
firm , was in 1998 . the review did not report any significant
problems .
the sec is examining whether andersen acted properly in
audits of energy provider enron , which is also under investigation
by the sec . andersen has acknowledged that the sec has subpoenaed
documents related to houston - based enron , which is on the brink of
bankruptcy after saying it had overstated earnings .
andersen ' s announcement comes as the public oversight board ,
an accounting industry oversight group , plans to look at the
adequacy of the peer review system amid concerns about the failed
enron audits . the system calls for audit firms to periodically
submit their reports on public companies for examination by other
accounting firms , in an effort to assure investors the firm ' s
methods comply with professional standards .
enron , the largest energy trader , this month said it
overstated earnings by $ 586 million over four - and - a - half years ,
inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion because of an
accounting error , and failed to consolidate results of three
affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
andersen was enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade ,
assuring investors that the company ' s financial statements
conformed with generally accepted accounting principles
u . s . representative john dingell , a michigan democrat ,
questioned the peer review process recently in a letter to the
public oversight board . none of the five biggest international
accounting firms has ever issued a negative peer - review report
against another , dingell said . the so - called big five also include
 llc , kpmg llp , and ernst & young lp .
` ` there appears to be little reason for the public to have
faith in andersen or the peer review process , ' ' dingell wrote .
andersen responded that it has faith in the accounting
profession ' s self - regulatory process , which the pob oversees .
a spokeswoman at deloitte & touche didn ' t return a telephone
call seeking comment .
enron ' s fall to spark legal wrangles over derivatives ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 30 11 : 24 ( new york )
enron ' s fall to spark legal wrangles over derivatives ( updatel )
( rewrites 2 nd paragraph . )
london , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s plunge toward
bankruptcy may spark legal wrangles over how to unravel the web of
derivatives contracts tied to the energy company .
enron is set to file for protection in the biggest chapter 11
reorganization ever . that ' s likely to mean the energy trader can ' t
pay on derivatives it sold as insurance against default by other
borrowers , as well as defaulting on its own debts and triggering
similar contracts bought by its creditors .
` ` if i traded with joe bloggs down the road , and enron owed
him a lot of money and he couldn ' t get it so he went into
bankruptcy , then he wouldn ' t fulfill his obligations under my
contract , ' ' said brian senior , head of trading at innogy holdings
plc , the u . k . ' s top electricity supplier . ` ` i don ' t think the
major risk is market liquidity , i think it ' s the domino effect . ' '
enron used derivatives - - financial instruments such as
futures and options whose value is based on other assets - - to
insure against price swings or take bets on a price ' s direction .
the houston - based company had revenue of $ 1 . 9 billion from
derivatives trading last year , more than double the $ 765 million
in 1999 , making it one of the largest traders , according to swaps
monitor publications inc .
by comparison , williams cos . , the no . 2 u . s . natural - gas
pipeline owner , had revenue of $ 1 . 29 billion on derivatives
trading in 2000 .
paul spraos , president of swaps monitor , a research company
that compiles trading figures , said enron only posts derivatives
statistics once a year so there are no figures for 2001 .
dynegy inc . abandoned its planned merger with enron on
wednesday , leaving it with more than $ 15 billion of debt and the
possibility of bankruptcy . as well as oil and gas futures , enron
trades derivatives based on such things as weather and information -
transmission capacity , known as bandwidth .
banned from trading
spraos estimates that as of sept . 30 , enron owed $ 18 . 7
billion on derivatives trades that went sour , though he said that
doesn ' t take into account the collateral enron probably posted to
back up the trades .
the european energy exchange today banned enron from trading
its products , while australian regulators barred the company ' s
finance unit , enron australia pty , from trading electricity
futures because its funding wasn ' t assured .
u . s . senate and house committees will investigate enron ' s
decline and consider new regulations for electricity and natural -
gas trading . the securities and exchange commission is also
examining the company .
enron had $ 201 billion worth of derivatives on oil , gas and
electricity at the end of last year , swaps monitor has reported .
that ' s measuring the notional amount , the face value of the
securities on which the derivatives are based .
` quantifying it '
` ` everyone will be looking at their exposure , whether they ' ve
got collateral , and quantifying it , ' ' said robert g . pickel , chief
executive officer of the international swaps and derivatives
association .
isda , a new york - based trade association representing more
than 550 companies that trade derivatives , designed the legal
contracts typically used in derivatives transactions . pickel said
those contracts are designed to address such situations .
` ` there are two potential issues relating to isda
documentation , as a result of the situation regarding enron , ' '
pickel said . the first involves companies that have entered
derivatives trades with enron using isda ' s standard contract ,
known as the master agreement . the second concerns banks that have
provided credit protection on enron in the form of a credit -
default swap , also using isda documents .
credit - default swaps work like insurance on a company ' s bonds
or loans . they pay out if there ' s a bankruptcy , default , debt
restructuring or similar occurrence , known as a credit event .
` ` if there ' s a bankruptcy filing there ' s no question it would
be a credit event , ' ' pickel said .
` can ' t tell '
enron ' s u . k . units are in administration , which has triggered
what lawyers define as a credit event , said simon firth , head of
the credit derivatives practice at linklaters & alliance , which is
acting for , the accountant for enron ' s
european arm .
` ` the documents are fairly robust , and we ' ve been through
issues before , ' ' firth said . he said that while ` ` each time the
documentation gets strengthened , you can ' t tell what happens until
you look at the individual cases . ' '
enron owes almost two dozen energy companies about $ 700
million . j . p . morgan , the bank that advised enron in the failed
merger with dynegy , said it was owed $ 500 million for unsecured
loans . canadian imperial bank of commerce was owed $ 215 million in
loans and credit derivatives .
in europe , abn amro may set aside $ 97 . 5 million to cover its
enron exposure . the energy company owes abbey national plc $ 164
million , and dresdner bank ag said its exposure is about $ 100
million .
` ` this one has left every head shaking , and people are
wondering how to organize by class of creditor and how to hire
counsel , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an analyst at creditsights inc . in
new york . ` ` lawyers are high - fiving . ' '
enron ' s legal woes to make bankruptcy case complex ,
2001 - 11 - 30 12 : 41 ( new york )
enron ' s legal woes to make bankruptcy case complex ,
houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s legal problems ,
one reason for the collapse of the world ' s largest energy trader ,
would add to the complexity of a bankruptcy filing and might take
years to resolve , experts say .
with dynegy inc . having withdrawn a proposed $ 23 billion
takeover offer , enron is weighing what would be the largest
bankruptcy in history and may go to court within a week . enron
shareholders , employees and business partners are lining up to sue
the houston - based company after its shares lost $ 26 billion in
value since mid - october .
enron restated $ 586 million in earnings because of accounting
irregularities , and questions surfaced about conflicts of interest
among some of the company ' s executives . the u . s . securities and
exchange commission is investigating the company , and that
wouldn ' t be affected by a bankruptcy filing .
` ` there are so many legal tentacles to this thing it ' s
scary , ' ' said chuck tatelbaum , former vice president for research
at the american bankruptcy institute . ` ` we could be talking about
a six - year bankruptcy case here . ' '
lawsuits seeking damages from a company under chapter 11 are
pulled into the bankruptcy case and judgments or settlements are
converted into bankruptcy claims .
fraud claims
among the suits likely to be included in a bankruptcy case
are claims by shareholders that the company misled investors about
its financial health . another category would be allegations that
enron executives improperly prevented workers from moving 401 ( k )
investments out of the company ' s stock .
enron probably would face accusations it broke energy trading
contracts . the agreements , known as derivatives , were used as
insurance against price swings in the energy market . with the
company poised to file for chapter 11 , it is expected to miss
payments under the contracts .
there ' s also the developing battle between enron and dynegy
over the failed buyout bid that might end up in bankruptcy court .
that might lead a bankruptcy judge to take a look at the
recent court case involving tyson foods inc . and ibp inc . , a beef
producer . a judge in delaware ordered tyson to complete its buyout
of ibp after their proposed combination collapse . tyson , like
dynegy , had said it wasn ' t fully informed about ibp ' s financial
problems when it negotiated to acquire the beef producer .
dynegy said today it plans to take over enron ' s northern
natural gas co . pipeline unit next month . dynegy said it ' s
entitled to the pipeline under the terms of its nov . 9 merger
agreement that gave it $ 1 . 5 billion in preferred stock in northern
natural gas .
enron could sue as part of the bankruptcy case to stop dynegy
from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the
pipeline .
complications
any chapter 11 cases would be ` ` inordinately complicated , ' '
said lynn lopucki , a law professor at the university of california
at los angeles .
the largest bankruptcy on record is texaco ' s $ 35 . 9 billion
filing in 1987 . enron lists $ 61 billion in assets .
other big companies , like w . r . grace & co . and sgl carbon
inc . , used bankruptcy filings to manage lawsuits , said ken
eckstein , a new york attorney who handles bankruptcy litigation .
w . r . grace , a financially healthy chemical maker , filed for
chapter 11 protection in april to cope with asbestos - related
lawsuits . sgl carbon is the u . s . unit of a german company with a
market value of more than $ 1 . 2 billion that makes products used in
steel production . sgl filed bankruptcy papers in 1999 to dispose
of customers ' suits over price - fixing claims .
what sets enron apart are the questions about its financial
viability , eckstein said . he represented customers suing sgl as
part of the bankruptcy case .
` ` here , you have a fundamentally broken company , ' ' eckstein
said . ` ` it may never emerge from bankruptcy . ' '
that makes it tougher to gauge how much other creditors
might recover , he said .
` makes me mad '
enron investors aren ' t optimistic about the future of the
company ' s shares .
` ` i took at least a 60 percent hit on them , ' ' said jim
anders , a columbia , south carolina , lawyer who has sold shares .
` ` it really makes me mad . i ' d like to get my hands on some of
those executives who were doing the insider deals . that really
shook people ' s confidence in the company . ' '
enron ' s fall was accelerated by questions about some
partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the
company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial
reports hid the significance of the partnerships .
enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some
of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their
dealings with enron , the company disclosed . fastow and other
executives later were fired over their connection to the
partnerships .
anders acknowledged that bankruptcy law puts shareholders and
litigants at the back of the repayment line .
` ` i know we ' ve had it and aren ' t going to get squat back , ' '
anders said . ` ` the company led us to believe enron was as solid as
ge or one of the big banks . now the bank is busted . ' '
enron might raise $ 610 mln in brazil asset sale , analysts say
2001 - 11 - 30 13 : 24 ( new york )
enron might raise $ 610 mln in brazil asset sale , analysts say
sao paulo , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . may be able to
raise as much as $ 610 million from the sale of assets in brazil ,
including two power plants and stakes in two gas distributors ,
analysts and investors said .
the u . s . energy trader , which is on the brink of bankruptcy ,
also might reduce the $ 700 million price tag on its 99 percent
stake in power distributor elektro - eletricidade e servicos sa that
it has tried to sell for more than a year , analysts said .
` ` they would sell those assets to make a quick buck , ' ' said
marcos severine , a power utility analyst at sudameris corretora .
about 56 percent of enron ' s $ 6 . 5 billion of overseas assets
were in south america , most in brazil , as of june 30 . enron said
it currently plans no change to its operations in the country .
the u . s . company is expected to file for bankruptcy
protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history ,
which may force the company to sell assets to pay about $ 15
billion of debt . dynegy inc . this week abandoned its proposed
merger with enron . enron , which had less than $ 2 billion of cash
as of last week , has more than $ 61 billion in assets .
enron may fetch as much as $ 190 million from the sale of
eletrobolt , a 380 - megawatt power plant , and $ 220 million from
riogen , another power plant , severine said . both are based in rio
de janeiro .
gas companies
enron also may be able to raise $ 200 million from the sale of
stakes in two natural gas distributors , said a spokesman for
petros , the employee pension fund of petroleo brasileiro , which is
bidding for one of the companies . brazilian energy regulators
already have approved the sale , though it still requires backing
from antitrust regulators .
if enron tries again to sell elektro , it may be required to
offer the company to the federal government at a discount or to
another private company , analysts said . the country ' s regulations
aren ' t clear , they said .
regulatory approval may delay any sale of assets in brazil .
in addition , price controls in brazil ' s power industry will limit
the amount of money enron will be able to raise from the sales ,
analysts said .
investors are demanding lower prices for power companies in
brazil after electricity rationing and price controls over the
past two years cut earnings of power distributors and generators ,
analysts said . elektro has posted losses for six quarters .
venezuela , mexico
a bankruptcy filing by enron would probably result in the
cancellation of its investment plans in venezuela , latin
america ' s largest oil and natural gas producer , analysts said .
enron had been slated to invest three - quarters of the $ 700
million needed to build a liquid natural gas processing plant with
state oil company petroleos de venezuela sa .
pdvsa officials declined to comment on whether the plant ,
which would cool natural gas until it liquefies , would go on with
a new partner .
enron , which also owns a small venezuelan power company ,
pulled out of exploration in 2000 from an offshore block in the
gulf of paria between venezuela and trinidad and tobago .
enron also has smaller investments in mexico , argentina and
colombia . enron holds 20 percent of a joint venture building a
$ 189 million power plant in monterrey , mexico .
tractebel sa took an 80 percent share in the project in
november .
colombia
enron and promigas sa , a colombian natural gas pipeline
operator , each have a 50 percent stake in centrogas sa , a natural
gas pipeline that transports about 400 million cubic feet of gas a
day about 900 kilometers from the northern guajira peninsula to
barrancabermeja , the main oil refining city in central colombia .
the gas is produced at an offshore field operated by texaco .
officials at promigas weren ' t available for comment .
enron closed its administrative office in colombia about
three months ago , leaving an attorney to represent it in colombia .
enron ' s argentine assets include azurix buenos aires sa , a
natural gas and water utility , and shares in transportadora de gas
del sur sa .
perez companc , which owns shares in transportadora , is
prohibited by law from increasing its stake in the distribution
company .
` ` if the law is modified , then yes , we would consider it , ' '
said mario grandinetti , head of perez companc ' s institutional
relations . ` ` but there are also economic issues to consider . '
bush spokesman fleischer comments on enron corp . ' s collapse
2001 - 11 - 30 14 : 48 ( new york )
washington , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - following are comments
from white house press secretary ari fleischer on the collapse of
enron corp . , which faces the biggest bankruptcy ever . the energy
committees in the senate and house have said they ' ll investigate
the collapse and consider new regulations for electricity and
natural - gas trading .
` ` the president understands that congress at all times should
exercise its proper oversight roles . that includes anything that ,
in a case like this , the senate sees fit , in terms of an
investigation into the collapse of a company . that ' s the purview
of the congress , ' ' fleischer said .
` ` as i indicated , the federal government , the administration ,
is already doing that . the department of treasury and other
entities are monitoring it . so i think we ' re all looking with the
same cause of concern . ' '
enron ' s board was compromised by financial ties ( correct )
2001 - 11 - 30 15 : 01 ( new york )
enron ' s board was compromised by financial ties ( correct )
( corrects percentage of natco group sales that went to enron
to 0 . 16 percent in 25 th paragraph , and adds that sales are within
council of institutional investors standards in 26 th paragraph . )
new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . plunged from the
largest energy trader to the verge of bankruptcy under a board of
directors whose independence was undercut by financial ties to
management , according to corporate governance experts .
enron gave seven of its 14 directors consulting contracts ,
sales to their business or donations to their non - profit
institutions , according to company and public records . the
recipients include three members of enron ' s audit committee , which
is responsible for financial oversight .
lord john wakeham , for example , a former leader of the
british house of commons , sits on the audit committee . enron gave
him a $ 72 , 000 - a - year consulting contract . john mendelsohn ,
president of the md anderson cancer center in houston , is also on
the audit committee . in the last five years , enron and its
chairman kenneth lay have donated $ 567 , 900 to the cancer center .
` ` to get on a board you have to be ` clubbable , ' but this
looks like collegiality turning to cronyism , ' ' said allan
cleveland , counsel to the new hampshire retirement system , an
enron shareholder .
enron , based in houston handled almost a quarter of all
natural gas and electricity trades . during the past seven weeks ,
its board has presided over a $ 26 billion drop in market value
that began after the company wrote down $ 1 . 2 billion in
shareholder equity and reported it had overstated earnings by $ 586
million since 1997 .
responsibility
as enron ' s shares fell , the company suffered a cash crunch .
it sought an infusion of capital and agreed to be acquired by
dynegy inc . , a houston - based rival . that plan collapsed yesterday
as investors balked at investing $ 1 . 5 billion , prompting dynegy to
withdraw its offer . enron shares today fell another 39 percent , or
24 cents , to 37 cents per share . the stock began the year trading
at $ 83 . 125 .
corporate boards are responsible for protecting shareholder
interests by reviewing the work of top executives . to accomplish
that , two - thirds of a board should be ` ` independent ' ' from
management , according to the council of institutional investors ,
which represents pension funds .
independence
the council defines an independent director as ` ` a person
whose directorship constitutes his or her only connection to the
corporation . ' '
` ` consulting contracts , donations to non - profit organizations
linked to directors , this eats away at independence , ' ' said ann
yergen , the council ' s director of research .
corporate governance standards established by the new york
and nasdaq stock exchanges say all audit committee members should
be independent .
enron board members , including wakeham and mendelsohn ,
declined repeated requests for interviews . vance meyer , a company
spokesman , said enron could not immediately respond to questions
regarding the board .
enron ' s board met nine times in 2000 , with each member
receiving annual compensation of $ 79 , 000 in cash and stock . every
member attended at least 75 percent of the meetings , except ronnie
chan , chief executive of the hang lung group , a hong kong
development business , according to company filings .
relationships
based on enron proxy statements and other documents , the
following relationships existed between enron and board members :
- - robert a . belfer , 65 , has been on the board since 1983 and
sits on the executive committee . he is enron ' s largest individual
shareholder , with 8 . 5 million shares , and is chairman and chief
executive of belco oil & gas corp . , which operates from an office
overlooking new york ' s central park . in 2000 , belco had $ 32
million in trade settlements and $ 1 million in option premiums
with enron trade resources corp . , an enron subsidiary .
- - john urquhart , 72 , a former general electric co .
executive , sat on the board until last may . he received an annual
consulting fee from enron of almost $ 200 , 000 a year as a special
adviser to the enron chairman .
- - mendelsohn , 64 , is a physician who was formerly head of
medicine at memorial sloan - kettering cancer center in new york . he
pioneered research in controlling cancer through the chemistry of
a tumor ' s growth and was on president george w . bush ' s short list
to head the national institutes of health . since 1996 , mendelsohn
has been president of the m . d . anderson cancer center , part of the
university of texas health system .
donations
mendelsohn joined enron ' s board in 1999 . enron has donated
$ 221 , 650 to the cancer center . lay and a foundation he established
with his wife , the linda and ken lay family foundation , have
donated $ 346 , 250 in the last five years . the enron foundation
pledged $ 1 . 5 million for a new clinic .
- - charles lemaistre , 77 , headed the anderson cancer center
for 18 years until retiring in 1996 . he has been an enron board
member for 16 years , is a member of the executive committee and
chairs the compensation committee . that panel awarded lay a $ 20
million - a - year severance package that he renounced two weeks ago .
- - wendy gramm , 56 , has held positions at the federal trade
commission and the u . s . office of management and budget and was
chairman of the u . s . commodity futures trading commission . she is
director of regulatory studies at the mercatus center of george
mason university in fairfax , virginia . she is married to phil
gramm , a u . s . republican senator from texas .
in the last three years , enron and the ken and linda lay
family foundation have donated more than $ 50 , 000 to the university
and the mercatus center , according to university records .
consulting fee
- - wakeham , 68 , a chartered accountant and self - made
millionaire , became a force in the government of former u . k . prime
minister margaret thatcher . he was known as her ` ` mr . fix - it . ' ' he
was the target of an irish republican army bomb in 1984 that
killed his wife and left him buried under rubble for seven hours .
enron pays wakeham $ 6 , 000 a month to advise the company on
european business .
- - herbert s . winokur jr . , 57 , is the managing partner of
capricorn investors lp , a holding company that owns natco group
inc . , a maker of oil and gas production equipment .
an enron board member since 1985 , winokur serves on the
executive committee , chairs the finance committee and was
appointed to a special committee created to look into how enron
was managed .
in 2000 , natco had $ 370 , 294 in sales to enron subsidiaries ,
0 . 16 percent of sales .
` ` business between companies linked to board members ought to
be discouraged , ' ' said yergen of the council of institutional
investors . still , natco ' s sales fall within the group ' s
recommended standards . ` ` we think that anything over 1 percent is
compromising , ' ' yergen said .
enron said in a proxy statement it believes the terms of the
sales were ` ` no less favorable than the terms of similar
arrangements with third parties . ' '
audit committee
enron ' s audit committee poses particular problems , according
to corporate governance experts . the committee is composed of
wakeham , mendelsohn , gramm , chan , robert jaedicke , a retired
stanford university business school dean , and paulo ferraz
pereira , a brazilian banker .
wakeham , gramm and mendelsohn are not independent , according
to corporate governance experts and standards .
` ` for the audit committee , you don ' t even want the appearance
of a conflict , ' ' said charles drott , a forensic accountant who has
testified as an expert witness in bankruptcy and business fraud
cases involving companies such as delorean motor co . and lincoln
savings & loan association .
the committee is spread across the globe , with wakeham in
london , ferraz in rio de janeiro and chan in hong kong .
` ` the question is why this committee ? ' ' drott asked . ` ` for a
big sophisticated company like enron , why did they choose these
people ? ' '
swift descent
enron ' s rapid decline - - standard & poor ' s corp . slashed its
credit rating eight levels this month to junk status - - centered
on its dealings with partnerships the company used to move assets
and debt off the company ' s books . many investors had complained
enron ' s financial reports obscured the partnerships ' businesses to
the point they were impossible to understand . enron ' s former chief
financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and
earned more than $ 30 million through their dealings with enron ,
the company disclosed .
enron documents filed with the u . s . securities and exchange
commission state that the board determined that fastow ' s
participation in the partnerships would ` ` not adversely affect the
interests of enron . ' ' the documents also say the board approved
all transactions involving partnerships that were brought to it by
lay and other enron executives .
` ` what went wrong at enron ? ' ' said patrick mcgurn , a vice
president at institutional investor services , which evaluates
board candidates for institutional investors . ` ` a lot of it goes

enrononline resumes some commodity product trading ( updatel )
( updates with trader comment in fourth paragraph , today ' s
halt in enrononline system in sixth and seventh paragraphs ,
trading at other exchanges in 10 th and 11 th paragraphs . )
new york , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . resumed internet
trading in almost one - third of the commodity products it normally
offers , as buyers and sellers sought to unwind positions following
a shutdown of the web site wednesday .
enrononline offered 472 products today , including natural
gas , power , metals and forest products , compared with 65
yesterday , spokesman mark palmer said . the marketplace normally
offers about 1 , 600 products for which enron is a buyer or seller
in each transaction .
the web site , which used to handle about $ 2 . 8 billion a day
in trades , shut for several hours wednesday when dynegy inc .
pulled out of a planned merger with enron , which is now poised to
file for bankruptcy . trading with enron has plunged on concern
that the company wouldn ' t be able to meet its obligations .
` ` people are only making selective trades , unwinding their
positions ' ' with enron , said david chang , vice president of energy
trading at bank of america in new york . ` ` people are adding no new
net exposure . ' '
trading has shifted to other marketplaces such as the
intercontinental exchange , dynegy direct and the new york
mercantile exchange , traders said .
trading disrupted ?
users of the system reported that enrononline stopped
functioning at 2 p . m . for about 15 minutes today , shortly after
enron announced that it was dismissing 1 , 100 of its u . k .
employees . the companied denied service was interrupted .
enron still isn ' t offering its full spectrum of products ,
said kyle cooper , an analyst at salomon smith barney in houston .
enron recorded about 825 transactions on the system
yesterday , down from an average of about 5 , 000 a day , palmer said .
houston - based enron is the counter - party for every trade at
enrononline . some of its rivals , such as the intercontinental
exchange and the nymex , are intermediaries for transactions that
are backed by funds from clearinghouses or banks .
the nymex traded a record 79 , 701 natural gas options
contracts yesterday and a record 228 , 728 natural gas futures
contracts on wednesday . by 2 : 49 p . m . today , it had traded about
133 , 000 futures .
the intercontinental exchange inc . , an internet - based system
in atlanta , said trading activity so far this month was up 65
percent from october levels .
enrononline had accounted for about 60 percent of enron ' s
energy trading volume . it also trades commodities by telephone .
` ` traders we speak to are still working on their enron
exposure , doing what they can to minimize that , ' ' said justin
fohsz , an oil broker at starsupply petroleum inc . in englewood ,
new jersey . ` ` trading has taken a back seat for the past few days
and i don ' t think this is going to change any time soon . ' '
shares of enron were down 8 cents at 28 cents in late
trading , compared with $ 70 a year ago .

agl resources ends services contract with enron ( updatel )
( updates with agl comment in second paragraph , closing share
prices in fifth paragraph . )
atlanta , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - agl resources inc . , which
owns natural - gas utilities in the southeastern u . s . , ended a
contract for energy services provided by cash - strapped enron corp .
to its virginia natural gas unit .
the two - year contract for gas , transmission and other
services began in december and was ended without penalties , agl
spokesman russ williams said . he said he didn ' t know the value of
the pact .
enron , facing the disintegration of its energy - trading
business and saddled with $ 15 billion in debt , probably will file
for bankruptcy , analysts say . rival dynegy inc . withdrew a buyout
bid wednesday after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s debt rating to
junk status .
atlanta - based agl said its business exposure to enron was
` ` minimal , ' ' and the end of the contract eliminates the prospect
of losses tied to enron . agl has 1 . 8 million customers in georgia ,
southeast virginia and chattanooga , tennessee .
shares of enron , which reached $ 84 . 88 just 11 months ago ,
fell 10 cents to 26 cents . agl fell 57 cents to $ 21 . 43 .
arthur andersen ' s enron audit is under review by sec ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 30 15 : 17 ( new york )
arthur andersen ' s enron audit is under review by sec ( updatel )
( adds sec no - comment in fifth paragraph , accounting board
review in 12 th paragraph . )
chicago , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - the securities and exchange
commission is investigating whether arthur andersen llp acted
properly in audits of enron corp . , which already is being examined
by the sec , a person with knowledge of the probe said .
andersen , the fifth - largest accounting firm , acknowledged the
sec has subpoenaed documents related to audits of houston - based
enron , which is on the brink of bankruptcy after saying it had
overstated earnings for four and a half years .
` ` as is customary when the sec investigates a financial
reporting matter of a company we audit , they ' ve asked for our
cooperation , ' ' said david tabolt , an andersen partner and
spokesman . ` ` the sec is reviewing our work as part of their
process . ' ' enron shares have plummeted to 30 cents from a high of
$ 37 . 50 as recently as sept . 11 .
enron ' s collapse has focused government attention on the
company ' s bookkeeping practices and the audits by andersen , which
last june agreed to pay $ 7 million to settle sec charges it issued
false and misleading audit reports about trash - hauler waste
management inc . u . s . attorneys in houston and manhattan , who would
prosecute individuals or companies if criminal wrongdoing is
found , are monitoring the sec ' s enron probe , the person with
knowledge of the investigation said .
` ` we don ' t confirm or deny the existence of investigations , ' '
sec spokesman michael robinson said .
enron restatement
andersen worked as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a
decade , assuring investors the company ' s financial statements
conformed with generally accepted accounting principles . tabolt
declined to say when the sec subpoena was received , or what
documents were requested .
earlier this month , enron said it overstated earnings by $ 586
million over four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by
$ 1 . 2 billion because of an ` ` accounting error , ' ' and failed to
consolidate results of three affiliated partnerships into its
balance sheet . last month , enron said it was the subject of a
formal investigation by the sec .
enron restated its financial reports as the company suffered
a cash crisis triggered by disclosure of the cut in shareholder
equity and the start of an sec investigation .
the prospect of dual investigations by the sec and the
justice department ' s u . s . attorneys arises because the sec only
has authority to file civil lawsuits alleging securities law
violations . the justice department has jurisdiction on criminal
securities law prosecutions .
parallel probes
the agencies often conduct parallel probes , such as the
current investigations of initial public offering practices at
some of wall street ' s biggest underwriters . yesterday , credit
suisse first boston said the manhattan u . s . attorney has dropped a
criminal probe of how it allocated ipo shares , while the sec is
continuing to investigate .
last year , the sec and justice department prosecutors both
filed charges against executives accused of inflating revenue at
hbo & co . before its 1999 acquisition by mckesson corp .
citing concerns raised by andersen ' s audits of enron , public
oversight board chairman charles bowsher last week said that
accounting industry oversight group plans to examine the adequacy
of its peer - review system for ensuring proper audit procedures .
under that system , each of the five biggest international
accounting firms is reviewed periodically by another firm in the
so - called big five .
non - audit work
enron paid andersen $ 52 million last year , $ 25 million for
auditing and $ 27 million for services including business and tax
consulting , due diligence procedures and help in preparing sec
filings , according the company ' s proxy statement . enron and
andersen declined to provide further detail .
asked if the sec request includes documents relating to
andersen ' s consulting work for enron , tabolt said , ` ` questions
about the nature of the investigation should be directed to the
sec . ' '
earlier this year , andersen paid $ 130 million to settle
private lawsuits alleging the firm allowed waste management and
sunbeam corp . to file false financial reports that cost investors
billions of dollars in losses .
in april , andersen agreed to pay $ 110 million to settle a
securities fraud class - action suit filed over its accounting work
for appliance maker sunbeam corp . the appliance maker filed for
bankruptcy protection in february . earlier this month the firm
agreed to pay $ 20 million to settle a class - action lawsuit about
its work with waste management .
enron fires u . k . workers , plans bankruptcy soon ( updatel )

enron fires u . k . workers , plans bankruptcy soon ( updatel )
( updating share change . )
new york , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . fired 1 , 100
employees in the u . k . as the energy trader sought to line up
financing for the largest u . s . bankruptcy reorganization .
enron ' s bankers , led by j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon
smith barney inc . , sought to arrange more than $ 1 billion of loans
to help enron trade while in bankruptcy , said people familiar with
the situation . the debtor - in - possession financing may be secured
in part by $ 1 . 8 billion in proceeds enron expects to receive by
selling its portland general electric co . unit .
enron is also considering using its northern natural gas co .
pipeline , which analysts estimate is worth $ 2 . 7 billion , as
collateral for new loans . dynegy inc . said it would seek to block
such a move by exercising an option to purchase the pipelines .
` ` this whole thing is going to be in the courts , ' ' said
kathleen vuchetich , who helps manage $ 1 . 4 billion in assets . the
firm owns dynegy shares in the strong american utilities fund that
vuchetich helps run .
enron will have 250 u . k . workers after the dismissals ,
according to a statement by , which is
overseeing the company ' s british operations . enron has 6 , 800
workers in europe and 21 , 000 total .
more firings are likely in the u . s . after its $ 23 billion
acquisition by dynegy collapsed earlier this week . that failure ,
and a credit - rating downgrade to junk , left the company short of
cash needed to pay its $ 15 billion of debt .
enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week ,
needs to pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is
responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated
partnerships .
pipeline debate
dynegy said it plans to take over enron ' s northern natural
gas pipeline on dec . 12 , even if enron files for bankruptcy .
dynegy invested $ 1 . 5 billion in enron as part of the merger plan ,
giving it preferred stock in northern natural gas . dynegy backed
out of the takeover wednesday .
enron likely will go to court to argue that dynegy didn ' t
have the right to end the merger , so it shouldn ' t get the
pipeline , new york bankruptcy lawyer robert christmas said . enron
needs collateral for loans to stay in business .
enron pledged assets of northern natural gas and transwestern
pipeline as collateral for $ 1 billion in loans from j . p . morgan
and salomon this month . the banks may not back enron ' s claim , as
they are more likely to be repaid by dynegy , said fahnestock & co .
analyst fadel gheit .
` ` i expect to see enron , j . p . morgan , citibank and dynegy all
in court fighting over who owns the pipeline , ' ' said jon kyle
cartwright , a fixed - income senior analyst at raymond james &
associates . ` ` at this point we put our chips on dynegy . we suspect
they had the time and expertise to perfect their purchase . ' '
biggest pipeline
dynegy will assume $ 950 million of northern natural debt with
the purchase . enron can buy the pipeline back if it pays dynegy
$ 1 . 5 billion , plus interest , within 180 days of the merger ' s
collapse , dynegy chairman chuck watson said yesterday . watson said
he would rather get the pipeline than recoup the investment .
northern natural gas , the biggest of enron ' s four gas
pipelines , stretches from the permian basin in texas to the great
lakes . dynegy ' s right to buy it ` ` is not dependent on enron ' s
agreement to our right to terminate the merger , ' ' dynegy chief
financial officer rob doty said today in a statement .
shares of enron fell 9 cents to 27 cents in early afternoon
trading . they had fallen 99 percent since mid - october . dynegy fell
$ 2 . 34 , or 7 percent , to $ 31 . 31 . enron ' s unsecured bonds were bid
at 18 cents on the dollar this morning , down about 3 cents from
yesterday , traders said .
enron , which got its start as a natural - gas pipeline company ,
was transformed in the past decade into the biggest competitor in
the business of trading energy . as part of the company ' s strategy ,
it shifted its focus from developing assets such as pipelines and
power plants to developing markets for commodities . as a result ,
enron has few assets it can use as collateral for loans .
on the brink
enron has been unable to raise enough cash to ensure it can
pay debts and is having trouble financing daily operations .
dynegy ' s decision to back out of the acquisition left enron on the
brink of bankruptcy .
northern natural gas can ' t take any action , including filing
for bankruptcy , without the consent of dynegy as a preferred
stockholder , dynegy said in the statement .
` ` from what i understand , dynegy has as strong a legal claim
to the pipeline as they can have , ' ' said commerzbank securities
analyst andre meade . ` ` they structured the deal in a way , with
bankruptcy as a likely scenario , to have good legal standing . ' '
meade rates enron ` ` sell ' ' and dynegy ` ` buy ' ' and doesn ' t own
shares of either company . he values northern natural at $ 2 . 7
billion , more than the $ 2 . 47 billion that dynegy is paying ,
including debt .
` ` dynegy paid fair market value ( for the pipeline ) , and they
have the law and the facts on their side , ' ' said john olson ,
research director for sanders , morris , harris group inc . , a
houston financial - services firm .
watson said yesterday he hopes that northern natural
employees won ' t quit after the takeover . enron and dynegy are both
based in houston .
` ` dynegy has contacted enron to begin a transition of the
pipeline ' s management and expect enron ' s full cooperation , ' ' doty
said today .

dynegy says pipeline option not dependent on enron ( update 8 )
( updates with closing share prices in 12 th paragraph . )
houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . said it plans to
take over enron corp . ' s northern natural gas co . pipeline unit on
dec . 12 , even if enron seeks chapter 11 bankruptcy protection or
challenges dynegy ' s decision to call off their merger .
dynegy invested $ 1 . 5 billion in enron as part of the merger
agreement , giving it preferred stock in northern natural and the
right to buy the business for about $ 23 million . dynegy backed out
of the $ 23 billion buyout of enron on wednesday and said it would
exercise the right to acquire the 16 , 500 - mile pipeline .
enron said it ' s reviewing options for northern natural , which
analysts estimate is worth $ 2 . 7 billion . enron likely will go to
court to argue that dynegy didn ' t have the right to end the
merger , so it shouldn ' t get the pipeline , new york bankruptcy
lawyer robert christmas said . enron needs collateral for loans to
stay in business .
` ` this whole thing is going to be in the courts , regardless
of whether dynegy wants this asset , ' ' said kathleen vuchetich , who
helps manage $ 1 . 4 billion in assets , 4 . 2 percent of them dynegy
shares , in the strong american utilities fund . ` ` dynegy may as
well be fighting for something worthwhile . ' '
j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . ' s salomon smith
barney inc . may join the dispute . enron pledged assets of northern
natural and the transwestern pipeline as collateral for $ 1 billion
in loans from the banks this month . the banks may not back enron ' s
claim , as they are more likely to be repaid by dynegy , said
fahnestock & co . analyst fadel gheit .

biggest pipeline
dynegy will assume $ 950 million of northern natural debt with
the purchase . enron can buy the pipeline back if it pays dynegy
$ 1 . 5 billion , plus interest , within six months of the nov . 9
merger agreement date , dynegy chairman chuck watson said today in
an interview .
` ` i ' d rather have the pipe than the $ 1 . 5 billion , but they
absolutely have the right to do that , ' ' watson said . ` ` that was
the deal from day one . ' '
northern natural , the biggest of enron ' s four gas pipelines ,
stretches from the permian basin in texas to the great lakes .
dynegy ' s right to buy it ` ` is not dependent on enron ' s agreement
to our right to terminate the merger , ' ' dynegy chief financial
officer rob doty said today in a statement .
after dynegy canceled the buyout , enron said in a statement
it was reviewing dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline . enron has
suffered from a crisis of credibility , integrity and leadership
for months , watson said . questioning the pipeline agreement ` ` is
not helping , ' ' he said .
` ` i find it out of balance that ( enron is ) questioning
this , ' ' watson said . ` ` to throw this out in the press that this
might be challenged is irresponsible and disingenuous . ' '
shares of enron fell 11 cents to 25 cents . they have fallen
99 percent since mid - october . dynegy fell $ 3 . 30 , or 9 . 8 percent ,
to $ 30 . 35 . both companies are based in houston .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes maturing in 2006 fell as much as 4
cents to 17 cents on the dollar today , traders said .
few assets
enron , which got its start as a natural - gas pipeline company ,
was transformed in the past decade into the biggest competitor in
the business of trading energy . as part of the company ' s strategy ,
it shifted its focus from adding assets such as pipelines and

enron bankruptcy case would take years to resolve ( update 2 )
2001 - 11 - 30 16 : 20 ( new york )
enron bankruptcy case would take years to resolve ( update 2 )
( updates enron shares in 12 th paragraph . )
houston , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is likely to face
a maze of lawsuits that would complicate a bankruptcy filing and
take years to resolve , experts say .
with dynegy inc . having withdrawn a proposed $ 23 billion
takeover offer , enron is weighing what would be the largest
bankruptcy in history and may go to court within a week . enron
shareholders , employees and business partners are lining up to sue
the houston - based company after its shares lost $ 26 billion in
value since mid - october .
enron restated $ 586 million in earnings because of accounting
irregularities , and there are potential conflicts of interest
among some of the company ' s executives . the u . s . securities and
exchange commission is investigating the company , and that
wouldn ' t be affected by a bankruptcy filing .
` ` there are so many legal tentacles to this thing it ' s
scary , ' ' said chuck tatelbaum , former vice president for research
at the american bankruptcy institute . ` ` we could be talking about
a six - year bankruptcy case here . ' '
lawsuits seeking damages from a company under chapter 11 are
pulled into the bankruptcy case and judgments or settlements are
converted into bankruptcy claims .
fraud claims
among the suits likely to be included in a bankruptcy case
are claims by shareholders that the company misled investors about
its financial health . another category would be allegations that
enron executives improperly prevented workers from moving 401 ( k )
investments out of the company ' s stock .
enron probably would face accusations it broke energy trading
contracts . the agreements , known as derivatives , were used as
insurance against price swings in the energy market . with the
company poised to file for chapter 11 , it is expected to miss
payments under the contracts .
there ' s also the developing battle between enron and dynegy
over the failed buyout bid that might end up in bankruptcy court .
that might lead a bankruptcy judge to take a look at the
recent court case involving tyson foods inc . and ibp inc . , a beef
producer . a judge in delaware ordered tyson to complete its buyout
of ibp after their proposed combination collapse . tyson , like
dynegy , had said it wasn ' t fully informed about ibp ' s financial
problems when it negotiated to acquire the beef producer .
dynegy said today it plans to take over enron ' s northern
natural gas co . pipeline unit next month . dynegy said it ' s
entitled to the pipeline under the terms of its nov . 9 merger
agreement that gave it $ 1 . 5 billion in preferred stock in northern
natural gas .
enron could sue as part of the bankruptcy case to stop dynegy
from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the
pipeline .
enron shares fell 10 cents to 26 cents . they have lost 99
percent of their value in the last seven weeks .
complications
any chapter 11 cases would be ` ` inordinately complicated , ' '
said lynn lopucki , a law professor at the university of california
at los angeles .
the largest bankruptcy on record is texaco ' s $ 35 . 9 billion
filing in 1987 . enron lists $ 61 billion in assets .
other big companies , like w . r . grace & co . and sgl carbon
inc . , used bankruptcy filings to manage lawsuits , said ken
eckstein , a new york attorney who handles bankruptcy litigation .
w . r . grace , a financially healthy chemical maker , filed for
chapter 11 protection in april to cope with asbestos - related
lawsuits . sgl carbon is the u . s . unit of a german company with a
market value of more than $ 1 . 2 billion that makes products used in
steel production . sgl filed bankruptcy papers in 1999 to dispose
of customers ' suits over price - fixing claims .
what sets enron apart are the questions about its financial
viability , eckstein said . he represented customers suing sgl as
part of the bankruptcy case .
` ` here , you have a fundamentally broken company , ' ' eckstein
said . ` ` it may never emerge from bankruptcy . ' '
that makes it tougher to gauge how much other creditors
might recover , he said .
` makes me mad '
enron investors aren ' t optimistic about the future of the
company ' s shares .
` ` i took at least a 60 percent hit on them , ' ' said jim
anders , a columbia , south carolina , lawyer who has sold shares .
` ` it really makes me mad . i ' d like to get my hands on some of
those executives who were doing the insider deals . that really
shook people ' s confidence in the company . ' '
enron ' s fall was accelerated by questions about some
partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the
company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial
reports hid the significance of the partnerships .
enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some
of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their
dealings with enron , the company disclosed . fastow and other
executives later were fired over their connection to the
partnerships .
anders acknowledged that bankruptcy law puts shareholders and
litigants at the back of the repayment line .
` ` i know we ' ve had it and aren ' t going to get squat back , ' '
anders said . ` ` the company led us to believe enron was as solid as
ge or one of the big banks . now the bank is busted . ' '
chairman says dynegy ' s right to enron pipeline indisputable
2001 - 11 - 30 16 : 21 ( new york )
chairman says dynegy ' s right to enron pipeline indisputable
houston , nov . 30 , ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . negotiated an
agreement that gives dynegy inc . the right to take over the
northern natural gas co . pipeline , and arguments to the contrary
are ` ` irresponsible ' ' and ` ` disingenuous , ' ' dynegy inc . chairman
chuck watson said .
on nov . 9 , dynegy announced it would buy enron in a
transaction valued at about $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt .
that buyout collapsed wednesday after enron failed to get
financing to run daily operations , its stock price plunged and
credit rating companies lowered its debt below junk , triggering
$ 3 . 9 billion in debt payments .
as part of the buyout , chevrontexaco corp . , owner of 26
percent of dynegy , gave enron $ 1 . 5 billion in return for the right
to take over the 16 , 500 - mile line even if the merger collapsed ,
watson said . watson said someone is telling reporters that enron
might challenge the takeover of the pipeline . enron doesn ' t have a
case , watson said .
` ` chevrontexaco is not going to give dynegy ( $ 1 . 5 billion )
which they know dynegy is going to give to enron - - a company that
has lost $ 90 billion in net worth - - without a pretty damn good
assurance that dynegy can get the pipeline or the money back , ' '
watson said .
enron said it ' s reviewing options for northern natural gas ,
which analysts estimate is worth $ 2 . 7 billion . enron likely will
go to court to argue that dynegy didn ' t have the right to end the
merger , so it shouldn ' t get the pipeline , new york bankruptcy
lawyer robert christmas said . enron needs collateral for loans to
stay in business .
` ` this whole thing is going to be in the courts , regardless
of whether dynegy wants this asset , ' ' said kathleen vuchetich , who
helps manage $ 1 . 4 billion in assets , 4 . 2 percent of them dynegy
shares , in the strong american utilities fund .
dynegy has notified enron by letter that it plans to go
forward , and he plans to take possession by dec . 19 , watson said .
enron has the right to buy back the pipelines if it gives dynegy
$ 1 . 5 billion plus interest in the next six months , he said .
` ` if the banks want to keep the pipe because they need
collateral to loan enron money , then do it , ' ' watson said . ` ` but
don ' t go out in the press and make it look like a big fight . tell
me what you want to do . ' '
watson said he would prefer to keep the pipeline system
rather than get the $ 1 . 5 billion back .
enron has suffered from a crisis of credibility , integrity
and leadership for months . ` ` this is not helping , ' ' he said .
dynegy shares fell $ 3 . 30 to $ 30 . 35 . enron shares fell 10

williams has withdrawn pipeline capacity from enron ( updatel )
( updates with closing share prices in fifth paragraph . )
tulsa , oklahoma , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - williams cos . , the
second - biggest u . s . natural - gas pipeline owner , won ' t let cash -
strapped enron corp . use its lines because of credit concerns ,
williams spokesman jim gipson said .
other gas shippers have taken enron ' s share of capacity on
williams ' s 27 , 000 - mile network , gipson said . he said he hadn ' t
heard of interruptions of supplies to customers .
williams competes with houston - based enron in energy trading .
the tulsa , oklahoma - based company continues limited business with
enron to reduce the amount of money owed by enron to williams , he
said .
enron ' s potential debt to williams is less than $ 100 million ,
williams said yesterday . williams negotiated with enron , the
biggest energy trader , for several weeks on reducing that amount ,
gipson said .
shares of williams fell 28 cents to $ 26 . 72 . enron shares fell
10 cents to 26 cents . they fell 85 percent wednesday after dynegy
inc . abandoned a takeover offer for enron after standard & poor ' s

new jersey has limited exposure to enron decline , treasury says
2001 - 11 - 30 17 : 06 ( new york )
new jersey has limited exposure to enron decline , treasury says
trenton , new jersey , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - the new jersey
pension fund , which covers 665 , 750 state and local government
workers and retirees , holds 2 . 65 million shares of collapsed
energy - trader enron corp . , a fraction of the state ' s total
investment portfolio , the treasury department said .
` ` the state has $ 70 billion in investments , ' ' said francis
rapa , spokesman for new jersey ' s treasury . the state paid an
average of $ 23 a share for its enron stake between june 1994 and
august 2001 , which translates into an investment of about $ 61
million in total . enron shares fell 10 cents to 26 cents today .
` ` that investment represents less than 1 / 10 of 1 percent of
our investment portfolio , ' ' rapa said . the state holds no enron
bonds , he said .
rapa said it ' s too early to tell if the state or localities
within the state would have to increase their pension
contributions because of the decline in enron shares but said
it ' s ` ` highly unlikely ' ' because of the size of the investment .

new york , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - wall street financial firms ,
banks in europe and asia , and pension funds from california to new

` ` this is having a ripple effect across the world , ' ' said
robert penaloza , a fund manager at aberdeen asset management asia
in singapore .
analysts estimate companies that lent money to enron - - from

s & p says credit derivative exposure to enron totals $ 6 . 3 bln
2001 - 11 - 30 17 : 18 ( new york )
new york , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - standard & poor ' s said
credit derivative transactions in which enron corp . may total
$ 6 . 3 billion .
the credit rating agency said it has reviewed credit
derivative transactions in which enron appears and found that
there are $ 3 . 3 billion in credit default swaps directly on enron
debt . another $ 3 billion of credit swaps exist in which a
subsidiary of enron is a counterparty , but the credit default
swaps is not on enron debt , according to nik kahkee , director of
s & p ' s structured finance derivatives group .
enron has more than $ 15 billion in debt and preferred stock
and about $ 4 billion in bank loans , of which $ 3 billion is
unsecured . swaps , options , and derivative risk aren ' t included in
those figures . banks and wall street dealers hold unsecured enron
loans and some sold credit default swaps , which provide insurance
to debt holders in case enron defaults .
enron ' s fall to spark legal wrangles over derivatives ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 30 11 : 24 ( new york )
enron ' s fall to spark legal wrangles over derivatives ( updatel )
( rewrites 2 nd paragraph . )
london , nov . 30 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s plunge toward
bankruptcy may spark legal wrangles over how to unravel the web of
derivatives contracts tied to the energy company .
enron is set to file for protection in the biggest chapter 11
reorganization ever . that ' s likely to mean the energy trader can ' t
pay on derivatives it sold as insurance against default by other
borrowers , as well as defaulting on its own debts and triggering
similar contracts bought by its creditors .
` ` if i traded with joe bloggs down the road , and enron owed
him a lot of money and he couldn ' t get it so he went into
bankruptcy , then he wouldn ' t fulfill his obligations under my
contract , ' ' said brian senior , head of trading at innogy holdings
plc , the u . k . ' s top electricity supplier . ` ` i don ' t think the
major risk is market liquidity , i think it ' s the domino effect . ' '
enron used derivatives - - financial instruments such as
futures and options whose value is based on other assets - - to
insure against price swings or take bets on a price ' s direction .
the houston - based company had revenue of $ 1 . 9 billion from
derivatives trading last year , more than double the $ 765 million
in 1999 , making it one of the largest traders , according to swaps
monitor publications inc .
by comparison , williams cos . , the no . 2 u . s . natural - gas
pipeline owner , had revenue of $ 1 . 29 billion on derivatives
trading in 2000 .
paul spraos , president of swaps monitor , a research company
that compiles trading figures , said enron only posts derivatives
statistics once a year so there are no figures for 2001 .
dynegy inc . abandoned its planned merger with enron on
wednesday , leaving it with more than $ 15 billion of debt and the
possibility of bankruptcy . as well as oil and gas futures , enron
trades derivatives based on such things as weather and information -
transmission capacity , known as bandwidth .
banned from trading
spraos estimates that as of sept . 30 , enron owed $ 18 . 7
billion on derivatives trades that went sour , though he said that
doesn ' t take into account the collateral enron probably posted to
back up the trades .
the european energy exchange today banned enron from trading
its products , while australian regulators barred the company ' s
finance unit , enron australia pty , from trading electricity
futures because its funding wasn ' t assured .
u . s . senate and house committees will investigate enron ' s
decline and consider new regulations for electricity and natural -
gas trading . the securities and exchange commission is also
examining the company .
enron had $ 201 billion worth of derivatives on oil , gas and
electricity at the end of last year , swaps monitor has reported .
that ' s measuring the notional amount , the face value of the
securities on which the derivatives are based .
` quantifying it '
` ` everyone will be looking at their exposure , whether they ' ve
got collateral , and quantifying it , ' ' said robert g . pickel , chief
executive officer of the international swaps and derivatives
association .
isda , a new york - based trade association representing more
than 550 companies that trade derivatives , designed the legal
contracts typically used in derivatives transactions . pickel said
those contracts are designed to address such situations .
` ` there are two potential issues relating to isda
documentation , as a result of the situation regarding enron , ' '
pickel said . the first involves companies that have entered
derivatives trades with enron using isda ' s standard contract ,
known as the master agreement . the second concerns banks that have
provided credit protection on enron in the form of a credit -
default swap , also using isda documents .
credit - default swaps work like insurance on a company ' s bonds
or loans . they pay out if there ' s a bankruptcy , default , debt
restructuring or similar occurrence , known as a credit event .
` ` if there ' s a bankruptcy filing there ' s no question it would
be a credit event , ' ' pickel said .
` can ' t tell '
enron ' s u . k . units are in administration , which has triggered
what lawyers define as a credit event , said simon firth , head of
the credit derivatives practice at linklaters & alliance , which is
acting for , the accountant for enron ' s
european arm .
` ` the documents are fairly robust , and we ' ve been through
issues before , ' ' firth said . he said that while ` ` each time the
documentation gets strengthened , you can ' t tell what happens until
you look at the individual cases . ' '
enron owes almost two dozen energy companies about $ 700
million . j . p . morgan , the bank that advised enron in the failed
merger with dynegy , said it was owed $ 500 million for unsecured
loans . canadian imperial bank of commerce was owed $ 215 million in
loans and credit derivatives .
in europe , abn amro may set aside $ 97 . 5 million to cover its
enron exposure . the energy company owes abbey national plc $ 164
million , and dresdner bank ag said its exposure is about $ 100
million .
` ` this one has left every head shaking , and people are
wondering how to organize by class of creditor and how to hire
counsel , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an analyst at creditsights inc . in
new york . ` ` lawyers are high - fiving . ' '",0

steve lacey , 45 , an emergency - repair dispatcher for a utility company in salem , ore . , has a personal life that reads like a holiday greeting card . he recently married his longtime love , and after packing boxes over thanksgiving weekend , they are set to move into their dream house in the country , just in time for christmas . lacey ' s retirement plans , however , are in ruins . he works for the embattled energy - trading firm enron , and has all his 401 ( k ) savings in enron stock , which plunged from $ 90 a share in late 2000 to $ 4 . 71 at the end of last week .
much of that decline has come since october when enron reported it had lost $ 638 million in the third quarter and later admitted it had overstated earnings from 1997 to 2000 . as their life savings shriveled , all lacey and his co - workers could do was watch . from oct . 17 to mid - november , enron blocked its employees from shifting investments in their 401 ( k ) accounts , while it switched to a new plan administrator .
lacey has joined a federal lawsuit that accuses enron of breaching its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in enron stock even after executives became aware of serious financial problems that would hurt the stock price . "" there was a lot of promotion inside the company to invest in enron and help us grow , so everybody got into it , "" lacey told time ' s cathy booth thomas . enron says it doesn ' t comment on pending lawsuits .
lacey and his colleagues could not have anticipated that they would be stuck with a plummeting stock . but their woes should be seen as a warning not to hold too much of your employer ' s stock in your 401 ( k ) and to regularly monitor the diversification of your investments .
like enron ' s , many firms ' 401 ( k ) plans can have blackout periods lasting from a few days to a few weeks when they change plan administrators . "" that ' s not necessarily wrong or illegal , "" says alden bianchi , chairman of the employee - benefits group at the mirick o ' connell law firm in westborough , mass . employees need to make sure their 401 ( k ) investments are diversified at all times - - in case they can ' t shift them for a while .
like enron , many other big firms match employee contributions with company stock . your allocation to that one investment can grow very quickly . and you might not be allowed to reallocate those matching funds into other investments until age 50 to 55 . at the end of last year , a whopping 39 % of total assets in profit sharing and 401 ( k ) plans were invested in the stock of the sponsoring company . among employees who are allowed to hold their employer ' s stock in their 401 ( k ) account , 18 % invested half or more of their savings in that stock .
financial planners will tell you it ' s a mistake to bet so much on a single stock - - especially that of the company you work for , whose fortunes already affect your job security and career advancement . planners often advise investors to hold as little of their employer ' s stock as they can - - say , only the amount the company gives them as a matching contribution . then they should shift assets out of even that matching stock into a mix of diversified stock - and - bond mutual funds as soon as they are old enough to do so . similarly , if your employer gives you options to buy company stock , don ' t buy and hold the stock ; cash it in and invest the proceeds in a diverse blend of stocks and bonds or mutual funds .
remember that it ' s your responsibility to arrange your investments so that they can survive any financial trouble your employer might suffer . as financial planner clare wherley of new providence , n . j . , says , "" it ' s not the company ' s responsibility to make sure your investments go up .

our 12 bulls , with an 18 % average decline , fared somewhat better than the s & p 500 , which fell 20 % from nov . 13 , 2000 to nov . 1 , 2001 . not much to write home about . but it was a great year to finger rotten stocks . our five bears ' picks fell an average 56 % . four bears qualified to reenter , and three chose to do so .
profund advisors ' william seale hit the bull ' s - eye by selecting transmeta as a stinker . in the past year the stock has fallen 95 % . he ' s back this year with a rap on carnival corp . already , one big cruise line , american classic voyages , has declared bankruptcy . now carnival , despite being stronger than most cruise operators , will suffer as the heavy burden of overhead is spread among fewer vacationers , he says . at a recent $ 23 carnival is trading at 16 times estimated 2002 earnings per share and is eminently shortable .
stephen n . worthington of barbary coast capital management foresaw trouble with the burn rate and debt load at wireless service provider metricom , trading a year ago at $ 15 . 75 . nice call . in july 2001 the company filed for chapter 11 protection .
this year worthington sees trouble brewing on the balance sheet of pacificare health systems . he cites an impending writeoff of the hmo ' s intangibles ( mostly goodwill ) , now 42 % of assets .
martin weiner of comstock partners correctly anticipated that a sagging market would dent enthusiasm for stock trading , as he picked broker charles schwab , which fell 57 % . for 2002 , weiner estimates a 20 % drop in capital spending for the semiconductor industry . so he says you should short applied materials , the big supplier of chipmaking equipment .
two new bears sign on for the year ahead : timothy ghriskey of ghriskey capital partners and cengiz searfoss , portfolio manager at west broadway partners . ghriskey sees a slide in nestle , as investors lose their appetite for food stocks in an eventual market rebound . searfoss targets eastman kodak for the stiff competition it confronts in a low - margin business .

morgan stanley chief investment strategist byron wien rode retailer target to a 23 % increase . now he likes oracle , arguing that it will outlast its competitors and that its share price already reflects the technology spending downturn .
thrya zerhusen , manager of the abn amro / talon mid cap fund , beat the market last year with a 9 % gain on american power conversion , the manufacturer of backup power supplies . now she opts for unisys shares , at just 0 . 5 times sales and 9 times her 2002 earnings estimate .
six new bulls join the contest . subodh kumar , chief investment strategist at cibc world markets , picks intel on the theory that chip companies lead technology rallies . michael mauboussin , chief u . s . investment strategist with credit suisse first boston , goes for enron , suggesting that the acquisition by dynegy will take place on current terms . enron shares are trading at a 19 % discount to their dynegy value .

falling star
the art of the deal
early this year , enron executives groused that wall street didn ' t appreciate their innovative business model , arguing that the company was severely undervalued at $ 80 per share . if only investors showed that kind of disrespect for enron today . the beleaguered houston energy trader ' s stock price tumbled to as low as $ 4 last week , threatening a merger deal with dynegy that is seen as enron ' s best survival hope . the latest free fall came after enron disclosed the severity of its credit crunch to regulators .
both dynegy and enron insist the deal ' s still on , and enron ' s shares recovered slightly after its lead lender gave it more time to pay off a $ 690 million loan . still , it could take six to nine months to finalize the deal .
forward spin
helping hands congress returns from thanksgiving recess to work that will involve a lot of giving and no small measure of thanks . the defense appropriations bill will get early and generous attention , followed by an economic stimulus bill that will be greeted with hands extended , asking that time - honored question : where ' s mine ?

enron , dynegy work to salvage merger deal

top executives of enron corp . and dynegy inc . raced to salvage a deal to combine the two energy - trading companies amid growing signs that enron is facing cash - flow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business .
the executives ' task gained urgency amid worries that enron ' s debt may soon be downgraded to junk status by leading credit - rating agencies . after holding talks with executives of enron and dynegy , representatives of moody ' s investors service inc . , standard & poor ' s ratings group and fitch inc . agreed to hold off on making any ratings move yesterday , people familiar with the discussions said . j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . ' s citibank , which are shepherding the merger and have already loaned $ 1 billion and agreed to invest an additional $ 500 million in the merged company , may arrange still more funding for enron , these people said .
"" i hope they err on the conservative side and stockpile cash , "" said ralph pellecchia , analyst for fitch , the credit - rating agency .
with few viable options remaining , enron ' s board late yesterday informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share tendered , down more than 50 % from the original offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , according to one person familiar with the situation . but the talks were still fluid as of late yesterday .
the latest proposed share - exchange ratio values enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , or a total of $ 4 . 17 billion . this would compare with the original value of $ 10 . 98 a share , or $ 9 . 33 billion . in exchange for reducing the purchase price , some members of the enron team were insisting on more control over the merged company . dynegy also was considering an additional $ 250 million cash investment in enron . dynegy , together with chevrontexaco inc . , has already injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in an effort to stabilize the company .
talks between enron and dynegy were said to be tense and occasionally acrimonious .
at 4 p . m . , enron shares were up 10 cents to $ 4 . 11 , while dynegy shares were up $ 1 . 64 to $ 40 . 89 , in new york stock exchange composite trading .
talks between enron and dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the price of the all - stock transaction after enron ' s share price had plummeted in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn ' t be as high as originally anticipated . on nov . 9 , dynegy originally agreed to buy enron after the emergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed enron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its shareholders . those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
while struggling to keep the planned merger alive , enron also has been seeking to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings . enron has a total of about $ 13 billion of debt , of which about $ 9 billion comes due by the end of next year . the company may find itself on the hook for an additional $ 7 billion in off - balance - sheet debt and another $ 3 . 9 billion in potential liabilities , related to troubled investment partnerships , if its credit rating drops to below investment grade , says mr . pellecchia , the fitch analyst . a cut to a junk - status credit rating could deal a fatal blow to enron , which needs huge sums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive .
enron , nowadays , seems to be generating less cash from that business , which accounted for more than 90 % of its profit in the most recent quarter . in the five weeks since enron ' s problems became widely known , its trading partners have sought to protect themselves by shifting deals elsewhere from the dominant enrononline trading exchange and to limit their exposure to the houston - based company . about a week ago , enron said it had about $ 1 . 6 billion in cash , which surprised analysts who expected a number at least $ 1 billion higher given the most recent infusions from dynegy and the banks .
enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company "" is continuing to meet all our obligations . "" she added that trading activity at the enrononline unit had been "" below average "" in recent days , but that the company believes "" it has stabilized . ""
analysts say cash on hand doesn ' t appear to be enough to keep enron alive for long , given the reluctance of its trading partners and creditors . rebecca followill , an analyst at howard weil in houston , says that enron needs a bigger cash hoard than ever to rebuild confidence . she reckons enron needs $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion on hand while the merger deal winds its way through shareholder and regulatory approvals .

deals & deal makers : banks , too , have stake in enron merger - - - stature , money are both on the line
by jathon sapsford and kara scannell

as important as completing the enron corp . - dynegy inc . merger is for the two companies , it is almost as critical for the banks that have backed it .
j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . have emerged as prominent financiers and cheerleaders behind the problem - plagued transaction , putting hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money into enron in hopes of keeping the deal alive . late yesterday , that effort continued , with the banks scrambling for new terms to avoid a credit downgrade that could scuttle the deal .
but in addition to putting their money behind the proposed merger , the two lending giants have also staked their reputations - - and perhaps even some of their prowess in the mergers - and - acquisitions business itself - - on completing this transaction .
both j . p . morgan and citigroup officials have said privately that the pending deal is a bellwether . that is because it could illustrate how big banking institutions can use their lending muscle to offer customers one - stop shopping , thus usurping business from the other , more - traditional investment - banking institutions .
because the banks offered financing to enron on short - notice to grab the advisory business , the deal has the "" potential for either giving a boost to a bank ' s stature on the street or to sling some mud in its face , "" said samuel hayes , professor of finance at harvard business school . "" this is a high - stakes assignment . ""
and an expensive one , if the deal doesn ' t happen . each bank has commitments outstanding to enron , in the form of various loans , of roughly $ 700 million to $ 800 million , according to officials familiar with the matter , and roughly half of that is in unsecured debt . the two companies , these officials say , have also committed an additional equity investment of $ 250 million each so far , though there is a possibility enron could get more .
as mergers go , the deal is relatively small , and it has gotten smaller in recent days as investors have hammered lower enron ' s stock , which at 4 p . m . yesterday stood at $ 4 . 11 , up 10 cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange .
but on wall street , the importance of the deal goes well beyond its size , where the transaction is seen as a high - profile example of the new era of finance in which large financials exploit the crumbling walls between once - separate businesses like lending , underwriting and mergers advisory .
goldman sachs group , an investment bank that doesn ' t traditionally extend large loans to clients , was denied a piece of the merger business because it declined to extend the sort of loans that j . p . morgan and citigroup provided last week .
should this deal fall through , it will make goldman look smart . "" there is a lot more to this deal for the banks than just [ mergers and advisory ] fees , "" says andy collins , an analyst at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray .
it is also seen as well as a major test of the decision in 1999 to repeal depression - era laws under the gramm - leach bliley act .
for decades , the u . s . financial system effectively banned commercial banks from lending to the same clients they served as an investment bank . the thinking was that commercial banks , the federally insured guardians of deposits , shouldn ' t be betting in the securities markets with depositor money .
now with those laws repealed , some worry about risks creeping back into the system . roy smith , a business professor at new york university , says the banks ' lending to the same clients from which they seek to win securities business could encourage banks to over - lend for the purpose of closing deals .
"" you can ' t believe the chairman of the bank is up at night thinking about this , "" says mr . smith .
the banks , while conceding some exposure to enron , decline to confirm specific amounts , citing client confidentiality . but in private conversations , banks say they regularly sell loans to companies in which they may be too exposed in an active secondary market . moreover , they use other credit derivatives to effectively transfer the risk of loans to other investors .
some of the recent documentation of enron debt suggests that much of the debt has been diversified across many investors . in may 2001 , for example , citigroup and j . p . morgan arranged a large $ 2 . 25 billion credit facility for enron , part of the total of approximately $ 13 billion in debt on enron ' s balance sheet ( not including commitments to other financial institutions ) .
those two banks , as lead arrangers of that financing , helped divide that loan up among 50 different banks , according to loan pricing corp . , a research institute the follows the lending business . many of those banks divided their shares into even smaller pieces and sold them off to other investors . one banker familiar with the matter said that , all told , more than 100 financial institutions have exposure to enron .
yet j . p . morgan and citigroup , who have served as the top underwriters of this debt , would rather avoid being blamed for letting enron ' s debts go bad . even more importantly , they also hold their own portion of that debt . thus , both banks recently provided an additional credit line to enron totaling $ 1 billion .
that additional lending , while enhancing the value of existing loans to enron , is also relatively safe because it is secured with hard assets . should enron default , the banks would take an interest in that collateral . "" that additional credit line is bullet proof , "" says one banker .
the banks , ultimately , have had a string of successes with similar strategies with other firms , though few are as high - profile as enron . these two banks , for example , are credited with saving companies like lucent technologies from a financial crisis earlier this year with a similar combination of financing and investment banking advise . but speaking privately , bankers concede that a failure of the enron deal would smart beyond what the damage might be to the banks ' loan portfolio .
"" if it falls apart , "" says mr . hayes , the harvard professor , "" it will be a source of embarrassment . ""

energy - trading market survives enron for now

enron corp . ' s precarious financial condition has unnerved investors and trading partners , but the largely invisible natural - gas and electricity trading industry that it helped build appears relatively resilient - - at least so far .
veteran traders say many firms began to take precautionary steps a month ago against an energy - market meltdown related to enron , when the first tidbits of the houston - based company ' s woes were reported . trading volume has moved from the popular enrononline electronic platform to other venues , some traders have unwound complex financial bets , and others have simply worked around their onetime trading partner .
as a result , insiders say natural - gas prices , in particular , haven ' t really been affected so far by enron ' s problems , and any impact is expected to be moderate .
unlike a traditional commodities exchange , open to all , natural gas and electricity are traded privately , with many transactions reflecting deals between two players . enrononline , for instance , acts as both the buyer and seller , setting the price for which it will buy or sell commodities such as natural gas or electricity . players such as enron , which had transformed itself from a natural - gas pipeline company , make money by buying and selling energy many times over , capturing the difference between bids from buyers and offers from sellers . but actual trading strategies are tightly kept secrets , which has made the business difficult to track and assess .
while the energy market has held up amid enron ' s woes , it remains edgy , especially given the uncertainty about what might happen if dynegy inc . ' s agreement to acquire enron is aborted . "" companies have stopped doing business with enron to the best of their ability , "" says art gelber , principal of gelber gas closed at $ 2 . 62 a million british thermal units in new york mercantile exchange trading yesterday .
even in a worst - case scenario , however , most traders assume that whoever takes control of the company ' s assets will probably handle delivery of commodities against its contracts , he says .
"" enron has caused some short - term price moves , but it ' s not a big part of what the market is going to do in the long run , "" says bill o ' neill , director of commodity research at merrill lynch & co . "" you have to remember that the fundamentals for energy , particularly demand , are not too good right now , because of the economy . ""
indeed , natural - gas storage is nearly full , and so far , warm fall weather hasn ' t helped demand any . "" a growing inventory of natural gas should have a moderating effect on any transitional difficulties that might arise because of a continued downward path for enron , "" says jon rasmussen , an economist at the department of energy ' s energy information administration .
one clear impact has been on enrononline , enron ' s electronic trading arm that had become the dominant energy e - trading platform in recent years , accounting for as much as 25 % of the country ' s natural - gas and electricity deliveries . the rival inc . has reported a 34 % jump in its weekly electricity volume since october , 13 % in natural gas , and a 45 % increase in crude oil . the atlanta - based concern is owned by about 100 energy and metals traders , brokers and banks .
other traders have returned to doing trades over the phone , a less transparent method than pulling prices off a screen . "" this is doing a lot to re - establish human contact , "" says one trading executive .

back in the mid - 1980 s , a pipeline executive called ken lay was fishing around for a name for his company , produced by a merger of houston natural gas and omaha - based internorth . he consulted with consultants , politicked with politicians , and came up with a moniker . the company would be called "" enteron . ""
three weeks later , fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked up the dictionary definition of "" enteron "" ( n . the intestine ) , he changed the company ' s name again . henceforth it would be known as enron .
a columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to extend the metaphor of the company ' s misbegotten name . in recent weeks , after all , we ' ve seen enron ' s stock collapse over indigestible accounting and the emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers that exude an odor of genuine malfeasance . the evidence is far from clear , but for the sake of mr . lay ' s reputation one hopes these missteps will prove one more case of a company fooling itself rather than setting out deliberately to defraud the markets .
enron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas , becoming the pre - eminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a vocal proponent of deregulation . now , all but overnight , it ' s kaput , just waiting to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an erstwhile rival .
we cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the 1970 s , phibro ( short for philipp brothers ) . hard to believe , but phibro was once a name that made grown men quiver on wall street . fattened by trading profits from the great commodity inflation of the 1970 s , which some mistook for a permanent new age of scarcity , it scooped up the street ' s oldest partnership , salomon brothers , tucking it into its back pocket and renaming the combined firm phibro - salomon . here was a powerhouse of unlimited potential , investors told themselves .
flash ahead to california ' s electricity meltdown earlier this year . enron saw its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being quoted in the california market . many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend , but there was no true energy shortage . posted prices on the california power exchange may have skyrocketed , but the effective price was zero dollars and zero cents , because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were thumbing their noses at piles of ious .
when prices are zero , suppliers take a hike - - that ' s what economics teaches . but once the state government started pumping its own cash into the market , the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful again . now california is swimming in power and nobody talks about an "" energy crisis "" anymore .
you can date the loss of investor confidence in enron almost exactly to the moment when the california fiasco began to repair itself . fortune magazine put the inaugural nail in enron ' s coffin in march , noting that the company ' s growing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil - patch version of goldman sachs . goldman ' s stock sells at a price - earnings multiple of 17 , reflecting investors ' well - founded distrust of trading earnings to be reproduced reliably year after year . so why , the magazine asked , was enron awarded a multiple of 60 - plus ? mmm . . .
enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation . boss ken lay , a believer in technology and the power of markets , was a true visionary , to the point of annoying people who didn ' t care for his air of being a man on the right side of history . the moldering pipeline he took over would certainly have been an also - ran if he had not thrown enron headlong into trading and marketing .
but deregulation doesn ' t confer permanent advantage on anybody . a deregulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting of plans and strategies .
add the fact that , despite the california bubble , there is no reason to believe energy prices won ' t continue their long - term relative decline as technology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional resources . add also the likelihood that information technology will continue to lower the barriers to entry to enron ' s trading business , which means more competition and shrinking margins . enron begins to look a lot like phibro .
the great commodity - trading machine was already running down by 1981 , when it bought salomon and wall street was swooning . inflation was being quelled by paul volcker . the products that phibro traders bought and sold were increasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges . "" four or five years ago , they used to be able to take other companies to the cleaners , because they knew where the market was and others didn ' t , "" a trader explained . "" with everyone knowing , within a few cents , where the price of any product was , phibro ' s ability to make a profit off its superior knowledge disappeared . ""
not only is this true of enron , but of its would - be bottom fisher , dynegy , run by mr . lay ' s houston homeboy , chuck watson . dynegy ' s proposed takeover of its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday .
while enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on electronic market - making , mr . watson was doing the opposite . his big play in the enron deal is to get his hands on the original hng - internorth pipeline , now known as northern natural gas . by having both feet planted in the real business , he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out of trading despite growing competition and transparency .
we ' ll see . dynegy and enron were born at the same time , and of the same motive . dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies , a washington law firm and morgan stanley to take advantage of new opportunities in deregulated natural gas . but the gnats are already circling .
gas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of their fate now insist they shouldn ' t be allowed to merge . don ' t listen to the fussbudgets . if this was a business in need of trustbusting , enron wouldn ' t have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings . as merrill lynch ' s donato eassey has pointed out , wholesale margins have been steadily thinning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive .
wishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies whose dearly held "" visions "" were not panning out . enron prided itself on being realistic and adaptive , but it failed to see that its own beliefs about the world needed overhauling .

trying to restore confidence in enron to salvage a merger
by richard a . oppel jr . and andrew ross sorkin

c . 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation and dynegy inc . worked yesterday to find ways to bolster confidence in enron ' s weakened energy - trading business as the companies ' negotiators continued talks on revising the terms of their merger , executives close to the talks said .
the renegotiated deal would cut the value of the acquisition by half , they said , to roughly $ 4 billion . dynegy , they said , was also prepared to invest at least an additional $ 250 million in enron , on top of the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from dynegy ' s biggest investor , chevrontexaco , included in the initial deal announced nov . 9 . but dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets , and the companies were trying to identify and value enough enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors , the executives said .
before a series of financial disclosures sent enron ' s stock into collapse and the company into the arms of dynegy , its houston rival , enron ' s natural gas and electricity trading floors did more business than the two largest competitors combined . they also accounted for the majority of enron ' s profits by far .
but traders and wall street analysts said the business had steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of enron ' s financial straits . many traders have curtailed dealings with enron , and the executives close to the talks said dynegy officials scouring enron ' s books were having difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading operation was generating .
the executives close to the talks said that the renegotiated terms for dynegy ' s acquisition of enron would lower the price to about 0 . 13 dynegy share for each share of enron , cutting by half the value of the deal announced nov . 9 , when dynegy offered 0 . 2685 share . if a deal is struck at 0 . 13 dynegy share , at yesterday ' s closing prices , dynegy would be paying about $ 5 . 32 an enron share , a 29 . 4 percent premium over enron ' s diminished stock price . the premium was 20 . 6 percent over enron ' s closing price on the day that the deal was announced .
both companies are seeking promises from enron ' s bank lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the merger closes . and they are also discussing adding provisions that could limit dynegy ' s ability to back out of the combination .
the two companies are also working to arrange a cash infusion of $ 500 million from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup that would provide enron with desperately needed new cash .
but there is growing concern that the cash infusion from the banks will not calm investors ' fears or reassure energy traders , leading dynegy to seek an additional $ 500 million in cash for enron . late yesterday , the two companies were hung up over whether enron , which has already used many of its most prized assets as collateral for loans , has enough assets left to serve as collateral for the additional money , according to executives close to the talks .
a number of enron assets were being examined , including some that have already been used to obtain other loans , the executives said . the assets include : transwestern pipeline , a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas - producing basins of texas and the southwest with california ; enron ' s stake in other gas - pipeline assets ; its 9 . 8 percent stake , worth about $ 400 million , in eog resources , a former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly traded oil and gas company ; and its indirect stake in hanover compressor , which manufactures equipment used to increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its flow on interstate pipelines .
yesterday , investors anxiously awaited a report by moody ' s investors service , which like other major credit - rating firms , currently ranks enron ' s debt at the lowest investment - grade level . if enron were to lose its investment - grade status , it could be forced to repay or refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , while other traders would probably further curtail business . but by late yesterday , moody ' s decided not to issue a statement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon , the executives said . a moody ' s spokesman declined comment .
executives close to the talks said that they hoped that new cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and the energy - trading markets that enron ' s trading floor would survive and remain a valuable asset .
but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring how much value the trading operation has already lost , and how much the business has been reduced because of credit concerns .
' ' i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase price as a result , ' ' said andre meade , head of united states utilities research for commerzbank securities in new york . ' ' i don ' t think anyone can estimate the earning power of enron over the next three to four quarters , and i ' m not sure enron has a good estimate . ' '
mr . meade said he did not believe that dynegy ' s earlier estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to its earnings was ' ' reliable today , given how sharply the business seems to have deteriorated . ' ' by mr . meade ' s calculations , if enron ' s trading volumes were to fall 50 percent next year - - even if normal volume growth levels returned in 2003 - - that would wipe out nearly all the value in the stock .
karen denne , an enron spokeswoman , said the company had experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the number of traders doing business with it , but both stabilized yesterday . she declined to elaborate or quantify the decline .
she also said that enron ' s trading operation remained profitable , though she could not quantify it , and she also said she did not know whether the company was working on a possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans should its business and liquidity worsen . ' ' we ' re moving forward with the merger , ' ' she said .
dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday .
shares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible revised acquisition agreement . they closed at $ 4 . 11 , up 2 . 5 percent , or 10 cents . shares of dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up 4 . 2 percent , or $ 1 . 64 .
though yesterday ' s gains halted a four - day slide in enron shares , the stock is down 95 percent this year after disclosures of major losses as well as significant accounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated profits during the last five years by nearly $ 600 million .
now , difficulties within enron ' s trading operation are exacerbating the company ' s overall liquidity problems in three ways , according to some analysts and rival energy - trading executives .
first , other traders are requiring enron to put up greater margin on its trades . on top of that , in some cases enron ' s traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas than traders at other companies . this credit premium in some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for every million british thermal units of gas enron buys , these people say .
additionally , many traders , like the mirant corporation , have either scaled back or stopped doing business with enron , hurting its trading revenue .
mr . meade of commerzbank said ' ' end - use customers and trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business to competitors as a result of enron ' s credit concerns and are reluctant to increase their exposures to enron . ' '

enron , dynegy pursue the right price
by laura goldberg
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
dynegy and enron corp . continued discussions tuesday on several issues , including new terms for dynegy ' s deal to buy enron and an equity infusion for enron , according to people familiar with the talks .
there was no sense talks were breaking down , but instead there were a lot of pieces that needed to be put in place , the people said .
sources told the chronicle on monday that the two houston - based energy traders were negotiating a lower exchange rate for dynegy ' s stock deal to buy enron .
the sources also said enron and dynegy were working with a group of banks to reach a so - called "" override "" agreement to extend , until after the merger closes , maturity dates for certain enron debt , and that the two energy companies were working to finalize terms for equity infusion into enron of around $ 500 million , expected to come from j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup .
dynegy , one source said tuesday , could also be a contributor to that $ 500 million .
under the nov . 9 deal , enron shareholders would receive 0 . 2685 share of dynegy stock per enron share owned . since then , there have been increasing worries about enron ' s core trading business and new troubling financial disclosures from enron .
the sources said tuesday the new ratio being discussed is around 0 . 15 .
dynegy spokesman john sousa said tuesday he could confirm only that dynegy was in discussions with parties involved in transactions related to the deal .
investors appeared optimistic tuesday that dynegy and enron would work out an arrangement to save the merger . shares in dynegy closed up $ 1 . 64 at $ 40 . 89 , while shares in enron closed up 10 cents at $ 4 . 11 .
wall street expects dynegy to either cut its purchase price or walk away . that dynegy is negotiating a lower exchange ratio shows it is very intent on keeping the deal together , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & co . international in houston .
if the deal falls apart , enron would likely see its credit rating cut to so - called junk status , which would trigger a series of negative consequences . among them : enron ' s ability to run its trading business would be severely hampered . in turn , enron could quickly be forced into bankruptcy .
enron ' s trading operation , which is highly dependent upon access to cash and credit , is already suffering . enron hopes another equity infusion will spur other traders to return the business they ' ve taken elsewhere .
"" it appears that trading counterparties have moved significant volumes away from enron over the past few weeks as a result of credit concerns , "" andre meade , an analyst at commerzbank securities in new york , wrote in a report tuesday morning .
that new deal terms are being discussed "" confirms our fears that enron ' s core trading and marketing business has been rapidly deteriorating and is worth much less today than several weeks ago , "" meade said .
tuesday afternoon , word spread among analysts and investors that moody ' s investors service would issue a rating report on enron before day ' s end . they were waiting to see if moody ' s would have soothing words on enron or drop its credit rating to junk , but no report was released .
enron is expected to lay off employees this week .

cooperation from enron key in probe
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
federal officials say they are willing to be more lenient with companies that cooperate in securities fraud cases , an attitude that could help get enron corp . off the hook in its current sec investigation .
but it could also put individual executives - - including its former chief financial officer and other former employees - - in the hot seat .
in the months since he took over as head of the securities and exchange commission , chairman harvey pitt has laid out policies that will give companies credit for coming forward to report misconduct such as improper accounting . the message has been that cooperation could spare companies harsher penalties .
the sec is so serious about its new attitude that late last month it took the highly unusual step of outlining the reasons it decided not to bring an enforcement action against seaboard corp . of shawnee mission , kan .
the pork processing and cargo shipping company issued misstatements in its annual and quarterly reports from december 1995 to march 2000 based on improper entries booked by a controller at a florida division .
in a statement , the sec said the company ' s conduct was key to it avoiding the enforcement action because within a week of finding the alleged misconduct , internal auditors did a preliminary review and advised management and its board of directors , who then hired an outside law firm to do an independent review .
four days later the controller who covered up the problems was fired , along with two supervisors , and the public was notified of the problem . the sec reached a settlement directly with the former controller , where she agreed not to violate securities laws in the future .
while the seaboard case is the only enforcement action to occur since the new policies were put in place , observers say it ' s likely they could be applied to enron in the sec investigation .
"" you won ' t see the sec be easy on anyone , "" said frank velie , a former u . s . attorney and partner with new york - based salans hertzfeld heilbronn christy & viener . "" but if you have an individual , or a small group of individuals who acted illegally , and the company acts swiftly to fire them , turn over information to the sec and cooperate , in many cases the company can escape prosecution . ""
since sec officials began looking into a number of off - balance - sheet partnerships formed by enron ' s former cfo , andrew fastow , the company has gone to great lengths to appear cooperative and to distance itself from anyone associated with the partnerships .
the day after an earnings report last month revealed enron would lose $ 35 million and take a $ 1 billion hit on shareholder equity because of the complex financing partnerships , enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay and the company ' s board of directors said they stood by fastow . the board had approved all the partnerships and dealings , it was noted .
a week later , however , on oct . 24 , the company replaced fastow .
on oct . 31 , the day enron said the sec had upgraded its review of the finances from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation , the company announced it ' s board of directors had created an investigation committee of its own with the power to take disciplinary action against any enron employee , officer or director who it determined "" . . . improperly participated in the transactions . ""
the committee took action shortly after , as several employees were fired for their involvement in the deals , a spokesman said , including ben glisan , a managing director and treasurer of enron corp . , and kristina mordaunt , a managing director and general counsel of an enron division . other employees who were determined to have invested in the partnerships , including fastow and executives michael kopper , kathy lynn and anne yeager , no longer work for enron .
in its sec filing that outlined more details of the partnerships earlier this month , enron again tried to distance itself from the deals by saying that it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards be put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly .
painting the company as a relative innocent that fell victim to the dealings of renegade employees may make sense in the face of the sec inquiry , but it won ' t ensure safe passage for enron , says henry hu , a law professor at the university of texas in austin .
dynegy completes $ 600 mln purchase of u . k . gas storage assets

dynegy completes $ 600 mln purchase of u . k . gas storage assets
houston , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . , which is buying
rival u . s . energy trader enron corp . , completed its acquisition of
bg group plc ' s u . k . natural gas - storage subsidiary for about
$ 600 million , its first purchase of energy assets in europe .
dynegy used cash and short - term borrowings to pay for the
acquisition , which was announced in july . bg storage is expected
to boost 2002 earnings , houston - based dynegy said in a statement .
the purchase includes two storage terminals , rough and
hornsea , which are used by about half of the u . k . ' s gas shippers
and can store 111 billion cubic feet , dynegy said . the business
also has 19 miles of pipeline and an onshore gas - processing plant
in easington , england . bg storage ' s 260 workers will become
employees of dynegy .
dynegy , which trades gas in germany , the netherlands ,
switzerland and scandinavia , has said it needs physical energy
assets in europe to support its trading business . dynegy is in
talks to lower the price of its acquisition of enron , the biggest
energy trader , from its current $ 23 billion in stock and assumed
debt .
shares of dynegy rose $ 1 . 64 to $ 40 . 89 yesterday . they have
fallen 27 percent this year . enron , also based in houston , rose 10
cents to $ 4 . 11 . the stock has plunged 95 percent this year .

natural gas , electricity trading appears resilient , wsj reports
2001 - 11 - 28 06 : 32 ( new york )
houston , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - despite enron corp . ' s
precarious financial condition , the natural gas and electricity
trading industry appears relatively resilient and prices haven ' t
yet been affected , the wall street journal said .
trading companies , which began to take precautionary steps a
month ago when news about enron ' s woes were first reported , have
moved trading from enrononline to other venues , the paper said .
some traders have unwound complex financial bets , while others
have simply worked around enron .
unlike a traditional commodities exchange , open to all ,
natural gas and electricity are traded privately , often with
contracts between two parties , the journal said . enrononline acts
as a buyer and seller , setting the price for which it will buy or
sell commodities .
however , the energy market remains concerned given the
uncertainty of what might happen if dynegy inc . ' s purchase of
enron falls through . companies that would benefit from a potential
trading void include american electric power co . , duke energy
corp . , el paso corp . and morgan stanley dean witter & co .
j . p . morgan , citigroup have stakes in enron purchase , wsj says
2001 - 11 - 28 05 : 53 ( new york )
new york , nov . 28 ( bloomberg ) - - j . p . morgan chase in both
1998 and 1999 , it had been less than a majority .
participants in the plan , which had $ 2 . 14 billion in assets
available for benefits , could only do so much to diversify their
investments . enron , like many other companies , uses stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricts sales of
the shares .
and they could only guess at the year - end makeup of the
plan ' s assets until the end of june , reflecting sec disclosure
standards for savings plans . by that time , the stock ' s drop was
already well under way .
trio of lawsuits
enron has since reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter
charges ; ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran
partnerships that accounted for some of the charges ; restated its
results since 1997 ; become the target of an sec investigation into
its accounting ; and accepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc . , its
biggest rival .
the company ' s shares , which ended last year at $ 83 . 13 , fell
as low as $ 3 . 83 yesterday amid concern that dynegy might abandon
its offer for the houston - based company . they closed at $ 4 . 11 .
in response to the plunge , employees in the 401 ( k ) plan - -
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax - free
savings , and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue
service code - - have filed three lawsuits against enron .
the suits allege , among other things , that enron prevented
employees from shifting investments within the plan between oct .
17 , the day after its disclosure of the charges , and nov . 19 as
the company made administrative changes .
all three seek class - action status on behalf of the plan ' s
participants . the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener
law firm , based in washington , on monday . it covers the longest
time period : november 1995 to now .
falling percentages
enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan ' s
assets at the end of 1994 , the year before the period associated
with the gottesdiener suit began . the figure reflected a one - time
contribution of preferred stock , and rose from 62 percent in 1993 .
each preferred share has a face value of $ 100 and is
convertible into 27 . 304 common shares . this translates into a
conversion price of $ 3 . 66 a share , about 12 percent lower than
yesterday ' s closing price .
the plan also owned a stake in enron ' s former oil and gas
unit , which became eog resources inc . after gaining independence
in 1999 . add in those shares , and company stock represented about
two - thirds of the 1994 assets .
enron ' s common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of
401 ( k ) assets available for benefits in 1995 , 58 percent in 1996
and 53 percent in 1997 as the u . s . stock market rallied , lifting
the value of participants ' investments in equity mutual funds .
the shares represented 49 percent of the plan ' s assets in
1998 . the proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999 , when the
assets more than doubled - - exceeding the 56 percent increase in
enron ' s share price that year - - to $ 1 . 62 billion .
how much choice ?
then came last year , when the common stock recorded its best
performance in more than two decades even as u . s . stocks stumbled .
enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and natural gas
prices , while the standard & poor ' s 500 index , a market benchmark
that includes the company , fell 10 percent .
company shares in the plan rose in value by $ 652 . 7 million ,
according to an sec filing . the total includes shares bought and
sold throughout the year . by contrast , mutual - fund holdings fell
by $ 47 million and ` ` other investments ' ' rose by just $ 134 , 000 ,
the filing said .
at year - end , the 401 ( k ) plan owned 13 . 9 million enron common
shares and 70 , 000 preferred shares , valued at $ 1 . 32 billion . this
total encompasses not only enron ' s matching contributions to the
plan , but also employees ' investments with their own money .
the company generally provides a 50 percent match , in stock ,
for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan . employees
can ' t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment
choices until they reach the age of 50 .
about 11 percent of the plan ' s stock holdings came from the
contributions , said karen denne , an enron spokeswoman . the figure
suggests participants invested more heavily in their company than
usual for 401 ( k ) participants .
waiting for data
for the average u . s . plan account , company stock amounted to
19 percent of assets at the end of last year , according to a study
done by the employee benefit research institute and the investment
company institute and published last week .
in any case , enron ' s approach to matching ensures that as
much as one - third of the contribution to an employee ' s account
takes the form of shares that they can ' t sell right away .
anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach , and enron ' s
stock performance , affected the plan ' s financial position last
year had to wait until june 27 . that ' s when the filing cited
earlier arrived at the sec .
employee savings and stock - purchase plans , such as 401 ( k )
plans , don ' t have to submit annual reports until 180 days after
their fiscal year ends . they can even get a 15 - day extension of
the deadline if they need one .
by the time enron ' s plan made its annual report , it was
already a bit too late to act on the information . the company ' s
shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of
the submission . as the filing demonstrated , employees looking to
save for retirement had been set up for a fall .

global investing - enron faces lawsuits over handling of pension plan energy trader ' s employees allege . . .

global investing - enron faces lawsuits over handling of pension plan energy trader ' s employees allege assets were frozen .
enron , the troubled energy trading company , is facing four lawsuits for its handling of its employee retirement plan , one of which claims $ 850 m in losses . enron employees allege that the company froze the plan ' s assets , stopping them from selling company shares they held in the plan as the stock price plunged .
the third suit , filed on monday night by the washington , dc - based gottesdiener law firm , also claims enron breached its fiduciary duty over the retirement plan when it sold employees company stock knowing the share price was artificially high . enron shares have fallen from a high of $ 90 in august 2000 to a 52 - week low of $ 4 . 01 as of monday ' s close . its shares began a rapid fall from about $ 30 in mid - october on news of improper accounting practices .
between october 17 and november 19 , enron "" locked down "" the retirement plan , barring employees from selling their shares . from the market ' s close on october 16 to november 19 , enron shares lost 73 per cent of their value . eli gottesdiener , gottesdiener ' s principal , said that his claim of $ 850 m was based on the drop in the value of the company stock in the pension fund from $ 1 . 3 bn at the start of the year to about $ 100 m today .
enron shares accounted for about 60 per cent of the $ 2 . 1 bn plan ' s assets at the end of 2000 , according to another of the lawsuits , filed by the law firm campbell harrison last week .
that amount was far too high for prudent diversification of investment , mr gottesdiener said . this was in addition to his objection to enron ' s "" lockdown "" , which forced employees to watch as their retirement savings plunged while the fund underwent administrative changes . "" we allege a breach of fiduciary duty under the circumstances , "" he said . "" knowing that people would want to sell their stock , and realising that enron was not the company they thought it was , under those circumstances , to lock people in , was grossly negligent and a violation of enron ' s duty . ""
the lawsuits raise several issues , such as a company ' s fiduciary duty in offering its own shares to employees in a retirement plan , and its right to ban employees from selling shares .
defined contribution plans such as enron ' s , in which employees allocate their retirement money from a menu of choices including mutual funds and company stock , are regulated by the labor department . they are not overseen by the securities and exchange commission , which oversees traditional mutual funds .
no regulation limits companies ' ability to start such "" lockdowns "" , beyond basic fiduciary duty . as a result , there is little day - to - day oversight of the management of the investments , said geoff bobroff , a former sec attorney and financial services industry consultant .
an older type of employee retirement plan - a defined benefit plan - has a 10 per cent limit on the amount of company stock that can be held in the pension fund because these plans are administered entirely by the company . but the legislation does not extend to defined contribution plans . mr gottesdiener said part of the reason he was bringing the lawsuit was to push for legislation to place the same 10 per cent cap on company stock in defined contribution plans that exists for defined benefit plans .
he added that when a company matched the employee contribution with its own stock alone , it pushed employees to buy more company stock , forsaking prudent diversification . "" as long as companies match their employees ' contributions in their own stock , people take that as implicit investment advice . ""
enron ' s only matching contributions were in company stock .

companies & finance the americas - enron works to save dynegy bid .

enron was yesterday locked in negotiations with dynegy , its energy trading rival , about reworking the details of dynegy ' s rescue bid .
dynegy is understood to be considering halving the value of the all - stock bid in the light of enron ' s deepening financial crisis .
john sousa , spokesman for dynegy , said : "" i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal . ""
dynegy ' s bid , launched on november 9 , is worth $ 11 a share - or $ 9 . 4 bn - but the enron shares were trading yesterday morning at $ 4 . 12 .
enron ' s fate still depends on dynegy ' s commitment to the deal , lenders ' willingness to restructure their loans , and credit ratings agencies ' decision not to downgrade enron debt to junk status .
a downgrade by the large rating agencies would trigger a series of collateral calls by trading counterparties . it would also oblige enron to repay about $ 3 . 3 bn of bonds . karen denne , enron spokeswoman , said : "" we ' re still working on an equity infusion of $ 500 m to $ 1 bn . and we ' re still working on restructuring our debt . ""
the most likely investors are jp morgan chase and citigroup , which have already extended a $ 1 bn secured credit line to enron and are the energy group ' s principal advisers on the dynegy deal .
"" you have five moving parts : dynegy , chevron - texaco ( which owns 26 per cent of dynegy ) , enron , citigroup and chase . all these people are horse trading , "" said john olson , of sanders morris harris , a houston - based investment banking and securities firm .
people close to the negotiations said enron was seeking further guarantees from dynegy that it would not pull out of the deal . enron is also seeking further cash on top of the $ 1 . 5 bn dynegy has already committed with the backing of chevrontexaco .
andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities , said that even if the deal were completed "" the underlying earnings associated with enron ' s trading and marketing business may be significantly lower than dynegy anticipates "" . creditsights , a credit research group , said the mounting shareholder and employee litigation against enron risked triggering a clause that allows dynegy to walk away if potential liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 bn .

enron ' s many victims

enron , the houston energy company that helped throw california into crisis last year , spirals downward . its stock has fallen from a high of near $ 85 to $ 4 tuesday . a planned rescue - merger is being renegotiated , and enron ' s executives are disgraced .
the only shame in this is that 15 , 000 enron employees have seen their retirement accounts tank right along with the company stock . we can only wish them luck in their lawsuit filed this week against the company , which urged them right up until the stock crashed to keep buying enron , then froze the retirement fund so employees couldn ' t sell their stock while the price skidded . the freeze was billed as an administrative necessity while plan managers were being changed .
considering that enron chairman kenneth l . lay made about $ 145 million on his stock options in 2000 and the first few months of 2001 alone , maybe he ' ll volunteer to cover some of the $ 890 million in retirement plan losses . fat chance . ditto the nearly $ 60 million that former enron president jeffrey k . skilling cleared on his options in 2000 . it was skilling ' s august resignation that helped trigger enron ' s decline - - that and disclosures that its executives had formed off - the - books partnerships that essentially concealed company debt .
enron ' s employees aren ' t the only ones holding the bag . enron and its chairman , lay , essentially invented market trading in electric power . lay was also a chief energy advisor to president bush , as he had been to bush ' s father . along with a handful of other companies , enron profited so handsomely from deregulation that california consumers , except those in areas with municipal power like los angeles , will pay the price in higher electric bills for years . pacific gas & electric declared bankruptcy , and southern california edison nearly did . the state itself is deeply in debt for the power it was forced to buy . major shareholders in enron , including the state employee pension fund , got burned . there is a lot of blame to pass around - - after all , edison itself was a main cheerleader for deregulation - - but enron remains a fat target .
lay ' s tendency to fulminate at the state and its officials at the height of the electricity crisis for not getting onto the free - market bandwagon deepened the wounds . when the price bubble fell victim to this year ' s cool summer , a declining economy and the state ' s purchase of long - term power contracts , the damage was done .
californians can hope that the securities and exchange commission will require companies to disclose the sorts of shenanigans that concealed enron ' s debt . voters can ask themselves whether state legislators ' inexperience , a product of term limits , helped produce such a shoddily constructed deal on deregulation .
nothing will bring back the ordinary shareholders ' lost money . at least the enron employee lawsuit stands a chance of recovering some percentage of the retirement fund loss , even if not a penny comes from kenneth lay ' s $ 145 million .

dynegy asks enron for new terms

dynegy inc . is insisting on steeply cutting the price of the $ 23 billion rescue offer it made to energy trading competitor enron corp . , as the companies ' executives yesterday continued to hash out financial and legal issues standing in the way of a new agreement .
dynegy confirmed that it was pressing enron for new terms , following the latest collapse of enron ' s stock price after the companies ' original nov . 9 acquisition agreement .
neither company would discuss the parameters of a new deal . dynegy is believed to be seeking a reduction of about 45 percent in its original offer , which involved a stock swap and assumption of about $ 15 billion in enron debt .
more critical than the stock exchange ratio , however , is how enron will raise more cash and capital to stay solvent over the six to nine months that regulators are expected to take to review a dynegy - enron deal , analysts said . enron has $ 7 billion in debts that come due over the next 12 months .
under the original deal , enron shareholders would receive about $ 10 . 50 a share - - more than twice the stock ' s current market value . enron shares closed yesterday at $ 4 . 11 , up 10 cents , while dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up $ 1 . 64 .
the new york times and wall street journal reported details of the negotiations on monday .
enron has little if any leverage , analysts said , predicting that a breakdown in the negotiations could trigger a series of events that would force the nation ' s largest energy trading firm and champion of deregulation into bankruptcy reorganization .
"" i don ' t think they have a choice , "" said ralph pellecchia , a credit analyst with the fitch inc . bond - rating service .
enron ' s stock - - which traded as high as $ 84 earlier this year - - plummeted after a chain reaction of shocks over the past month tied to enron ' s disclosures that some executives were involved in investment partnerships whose debts were kept off enron ' s balance sheet . the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation of enron ' s finances and enron had to make a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity and acknowledge a $ 586 million reduction in earnings for the past four years .
ratings services have withheld new assessments of enron ' s creditworthiness while the companies attempt to restructure their deal .
the ratings assessments are critical because enron ' s debt is now rated just one step above junk bond status . if it sinks to that level , lenders could begin demanding repayment on more than $ 3 billion in enron debt , precipitating what would likely be a fatal cash drain , analysts said .
"" enron ' s investment grade rating is based in great part on the expectation that the merger with dynegy will go forward , "" pellecchia said .
growing concerns about enron ' s survival have stymied attempts by its bankers , j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , to raise as much as $ 2 billion for enron over the past two weeks . the two banks are prepared to advance $ 250 million each and are trying to find other lenders willing to advance up to $ 1 . 5 billion more , according to sources familiar with the plan .
meanwhile , some companies have avoided selling energy to enron ' s trading operation , fearing they won ' t be paid .
investors and lenders urgently need a clear signal that dynegy is determined to proceed , on new terms , pellecchia and other analysts said . the combination of the two companies would create a dominant trading operation in energy products and related financial instruments , but regulatory reviews are likely to extend for six months or more , and investors want to see whether dynegy is prepared to stay that course .
another ongoing issue is the mounting lawsuits against enron by shareholders and employees . under the merger agreement , dynegy can walk away if it judges that the successful claims against enron from such suits will exceed $ 3 . 5 billion .
several enron employees have filed suit claiming that the company mismanaged its 401 ( k ) employee retirement plan , which , combined with concealment of its financial problems , has devastated employees ' savings .
the suit cites enron ' s policy that the company ' s matching contributions would be made only in enron stock , and that employees could not sell these shares until they reached age 50 .
additionally , enron froze the retirement accounts from the close of trading oct . 26 , about the time when the depth of its problems was becoming clear , until the morning of nov . 13 , in order to make a planned change in the management of the account , a company spokesman said . ( the employee lawsuit contends that the freeze covered a slightly longer period . ) during the freeze , employees could not sell enron shares that they had purchased as their retirement contribution .
"" the message to employees [ investing in enron stock ] was , everything was going great , "" said washington lawyer eli gottesdiener , who represents the employees in the suit .

dynegy refigures enron offer takeover : buyer lowers price ; energy trader ' s stock stabilizes . rating agencies show restraint .

new york - - the dramatic slide in the stock of energy trader enron corp . halted tuesday , as its intended rescuer , rival dynegy inc . , confirmed that it is renegotiating the terms of the takeover .
wall street read the news as a sign of at least some improvement in the chances that the deal will go through . but enron stock rose only 10 cents to $ 4 . 11 in new york stock exchange trading , so confidence in enron ' s survivability remains tepid , traders said .
dynegy shares rallied $ 1 . 64 , or 4 % , to $ 40 . 89 on the big board , as investors anticipated a new deal at a lower price .
reached tuesday evening , a spokeswoman for enron said , "" we don ' t expect an announcement tonight . ""
the two companies , both based in houston , have agreed on a new price of 0 . 15 dynegy share for each enron share , or $ 6 . 13 a share at tuesday ' s closing price for dynegy , a person familiar with the negotiations said tuesday . that revalued figure is more than 40 % below the original price announced nov . 9 .
the terms also would include another interim infusion of cash to help stabilize enron ' s trading business and enable it to make a $ 690 - million payment due creditors dec . 14 , the person said .
he said it was unclear how big the infusion would be and whether the money all would come from dynegy and its 26 % owner , chevrontexaco corp . , or whether a portion would come from enron ' s bankers as part of a restructuring of enron ' s debt .
chevrontexaco provided enron an immediate $ 1 . 5 billion in cash at the time the takeover was announced . in return , enron agreed to sell its northern natural gas co . pipeline subsidiary to dynegy .
enron ' s efforts to attract additional equity investments of up to $ 2 billion so far have failed . bloomberg news reported tuesday that enron ' s bankers , led by j . p . morgan chase & co . , have had their overtures rejected by saudi prince alwaleed bin talal , carlyle group inc . and blackstone group .
the major credit - rating agencies again tuesday refrained from downgrading enron ' s bonds to junk status , awaiting word of a restructured deal .
some analysts theorized that , by deferring a downgrade of enron ' s bonds to junk status , rating agencies were cutting the company more slack than normal because they are conscious that such a downgrade would send the company into bankruptcy . that in turn could cause what one analyst termed a meltdown of financial markets , given enron ' s long reach in accounting for as much as 25 % of all electric power and natural gas traded globally .
ronald m . barone , analyst at standard & poor ' s rating agency in new york , said he was surprised no deal was struck as of tuesday evening . "" we ' re still waiting , "" he said .
under the terms of some of its controversial deals involving limited partnerships established and run by former enron executives , a rating cut to below investment grade would trigger a requirement that enron make immediate cash payments to creditors . such payments would total $ 3 . 9 billion , enron said in a recent filing with the securities and exchange commission .
the sec is investigating the limited - partnership arrangements and the circumstances that caused enron to dramatically restate its official financial statements , erasing more than $ 580 million in reported profit since 1997 .
enron also faces a raft of lawsuits by ordinary stockholders and by employees who contend they were misled about the firm ' s financial condition and induced to invest in company stock when executives knew it was overvalued .
enron ' s core trading business has been deteriorating as nervous trading partners have reduced their exposure to a possible bankruptcy , said energy analyst michael heim at a . g . edwards those deals are evaporating as enron ' s fate remains uncertain , he said .

ratings agencies agree to hold off on ratings move on enron for now - wsj

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - representatives of moody ' s investors service inc , standard & poor ' s corp and fitch inc yesterday agreed to hold off on making any ratings move on the long - term debt of enron corp , which is currently just one notch above junk status , the wall street journal reported citing people close to the talks .
the ratings agencies yesterday met with executives of enron and dynegy inc , which is trying to buy enron , as the companies continued talks aimed at salvaging their two - week old deal .
a downgrade to junk status would be critical for the troubled enron , as it would trigger payment obligations on a large part of its debt , which totals about 13 bln usd , 9 bln usd of which is due by the end of next year .
the company may find itself on the hook for an additional 7 bln usd in off - balance - sheet debt and another 3 . 9 bln usd in potential liabilities , related to troubled investment partnerships , if its credit rating drops to below investment grade , fitch analyst ralph pellecchia said , according to the paper .
it would also make it more expensive for the company to raise the financing needed to keep its trading operations alive .
enron yesterday informally agreed to a new share - exchange ratio of 0 . 12 shares of dynegy for each enron share owned , down more than 50 pct from the original ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share owned , the paper said .
but the new ratio , which values enron at 4 . 91 usd a share , or a total of 4 . 17 bln usd , compared with the original value of 10 . 98 usd a share , or a total of 9 . 33 bln usd , has not been officially agreed upon , and talks - - which are reported to be tense - - are set to continue .
the talks began at the weekend , sparked by a steep decline in enron ' s share price in the past two weeks following revelations of new liquidity problems in a filing to the sec last week .

india : india ' s ongc says rejects bg offer on fields .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
bombay , nov 28 ( reuters ) - india ' s oil and natural gas corporation ( ongc ) has rejected a bid by british energy giant bg plc to become the operator of three prized oil and gas fields off india ' s west coast , an ongc spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the decision could jeopardise the british oil and gas producer ' s $ 388 - million deal to buy a 30 percent stake in the fields from u . s . energy firm enron corp .
the deal , signed in october , was conditional on bg becoming the operator of the fields with full control over day - to - day management .
the ongc board , which met late on tuesday evening , decided that bg ' s offer was not "" sufficiently responsive "" for it to become the operator of the fields , the spokeswoman told reuters . she did not elaborate on the reasons for rejecting the bg bid . ongc ' s move could also affect enron , which desperately needs cash to stave off a mounting debt crisis in the united states . the houston - based energy trader needs at least $ 1 billion cash to shore up its balance sheet and keep rating agencies from junking its debt .
the spokesman for bg was not immediately available for comment .
the panna , mukta and tapti fields , considered one of india ' s prized discoveries in the last two decades , were being jointly owned by ongc , enron oil and gas india ltd , wholly - owned unit of enron corp , and reliance industries ltd , the country ' s biggest petrochemicals maker .
the panna - mukta oilfields have recoverable reserves of 184 million barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas . they are proposed to be expanded to 214 ( mmboe ) . the tapti gas field has reserves of 96 . 3 billion cubic metres of gas equivalent .
enron , with 30 percent stake , was the sole operator , and bg wanted that situation to continue after the buyout .
but this was opposed by ongc and reliance . both companies staked their own independent claims , saying that they had the expertise to manage the fields on their own .
bg then tried to solve the dispute by offering ongc the right to operate another field in brazil if it withdrew its claim for panna , mukta and tapti .

australia : pacific hydro to select wind turbine maker .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
melbourne , nov 28 ( reuters ) - renewable power generator pacific hydro ltd said on wednesday it expected to select a wind turbine company to set up australian manufacturing for its proposed a $ 300 million portland wind farm by mid - january .
pacific hydro managing director jeff harding said the company had shortlisted danish company neg micon and a consortium of enron corp and siemens .
"" we will select them within the next six to eight weeks or so , but the manufacturing will only go ahead if we get approval for the project , "" he said .
the selected manufacturer would initially provide turbines for the portland project , but harding said it was expected to provide the base for other wind project manufacturing .
a number of companies are looking at boosting wind generation in australia as a result of a federal government target to boost renewable energy use by two percent by 2010 .
pacific hydro ' s portland project would comprise 120 wind generators with a capacity of about 180 mw , and is expecting to gain environmental approvals around april next year .
the company , which also has a range of hydro projects in australia and asia , has identified 2 , 991 mw of potential australian wind generation projects .
"" we expect to have a minimum of 500 mw operational within three to four years , "" harding said .
pacific hydro is a joint venture partner with aboitiz in the phillipines 70 mw bakun hydro project which started operation during the past financial year .
work on the second stage of bakun , which will boost output by 50 percent , is due to start in 2002 , with pacific hydro and aboitiz , also planning another hydro project .
pacific hydro reported a net profit after tax and abnormals of a $ 26 . 9 million for the year ended june 30 , up from a $ 8 . 8 million the year previously due to the start of bakun and an abnormal foreign exchange benefit .
harding said the profit growth would slow this financial year , with the portland project not likely to make its first contribution until 2002 / 03 .
"" it will be slightly ahead of last year but we won ' t have that quantum jump which we had this last year , that reflected the completion of bakun , "" he said .
pacific hydro shares ended wednesday up seven cents at a $ 4 . 30 , while the broader market was down 0 . 1 percent .

houston energy firm dynegy inc . confirmed tuesday it is renegotiating its acquisition of crosstown rival enron corp . dynegy spokesman steve stengel said the company is in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction "" in relation to the structure of the deal . "" he would not elaborate . enron did not return calls seeking comment . sources close to the transaction said monday the two were back at the negotiating table after a steep drop in enron ' s stock price , and analysts said dynegy was pushing for $ 5 . 25 per share . the wall street journal said the two were discussing a valuation haircut of about 40 % , from $ 10 . 41 per share , or a total of $ 9 billion , to less than $ 6 per share , or a total of about $ 5 billion . - claire poole www . thedeal . com

the high - profile deal to merge energy marketers enron corp . and dynegy inc . has gone back to the drawing board .
meanwhile , enron reportedly has made progress securing more than $ 1 . 5 billion in new cash to keep its business stable while it renegotiates with dynegy .
dynegy confirmed tuesday that it is in talks to renegotiate its $ 9 billion deal to buy its larger but troubled rival .
the disclosure sent enron shares up 2 . 5 percent , apparently easing some investors ' concerns that the deal would fall through .
in trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares rose 10 cents to close at $ 4 . 11 - - a stark contrast to days of double - digit declines . dynegy shares rose $ 1 . 64 , to $ 40 . 89 .
"" there are discussions occurring related to the structure of the transaction , "" said dynegy spokesman steve stengel .
while news that the two houston - based companies were renegotiating temporarily appeased investors , observers said they won ' t be confident about the deal ' s future until they hear details about new cash infusions to help keep enron afloat .
"" putting more money into the deal to shore up enron ' s credit situation , that would be a sign that dynegy would be committed to the deal going through , "" said analyst mike heim of a . g . edwards & sons .
late tuesday , the financial times of london reported on its web site that a consortium of investors is proposing a $ 1 billion equity investment in enron , citing a person close to the talks . the newspaper didn ' t identify these investors , but said an agreement could be announced wednesday .
separately , the wall street journal reported on its web site that j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . ' s citibank , which are advising on the dynegy buyout , have agreed to invest $ 500 million in the merged company and have said they would consider increasing that amount if they fail to find additional outside investors for the deal .
the journal , citing people close to the discussions , also said dynegy and enron have tentatively agreed to cut the value of the all - stock deal in half . under the new deal , enron shareholders would get 0 . 12 dynegy share for each enron share held .
that would value enron at $ 4 . 17 billion . the original deal , valued at $ 9 billion , was based on an exchange rate of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share .

houston , nov 27 ( reuters ) - energy trader dynegy inc . and floundering rival enron corp . hammered away at new terms for their proposed merger late tuesday , and sources said talks included a buyout offer half the original price and fervent efforts to secure financing to stave off a credit downgrade .
the sources familiar with the negotiations said investment banks j . p . morgan and citigroup , who are advisors and have already loaned enron a total of $ 1 billion , may have to step up with a combined $ 500 million to help save the deal .
this follows several rebuffs of enron by prominent private equity firms , although a source said the houston company was entertaining an offer of $ 1 billion from outside investors .
dynegy had planned to buy its houston rival for $ 9 billion in stock and is currently in a "" due diligence "" examination of enron ' s complex financial records that began before the thanksgiving holiday last thursday .
the first buyout offer , finalized nov . 9 , would have had dynegy paying about $ 10 . 41 for each share of enron , but enron ' s shares have since cratered to near $ 4 , stoking investor fears the merger will not go through .
it is abundantly clear that the deal will be changed if it is to proceed . sources close to the negotiations said the stock exchange ratio is likely to fall into the range of 0 . 12 to 0 . 15 dynegy shares for each enron share , about half of the originally proposed valuation of 0 . 2685 to 1 .
enron had tentatively accepted the lower end of that range , but a source cautioned that the talks were still very active and the terms very fluid .
also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of enron ' s debt past the close of the merger , expected in the third quarter of 2002 , as another move against a credit cut .
outside offer entertained
as for the outside offer of $ 1 billion , a source said the investment is designed to shore up enron ' s balance sheet and keep rating agencies from junking its credit . a credit downgrade would cause some $ 3 . 9 billion in obligations to become due immediately .
"" it ' s all about getting money to protect assets and intellectual property , "" the source told reuters .
an announcement could come as early as wednesday , but it could take longer , the source said .
the source declined to identify the parties , and would neither confirm or deny that goldman sachs was among them . sources close to the investment bank have told reuters recently that goldman is looking at ways to be part of enron ' s power trading business .
dynegy spokesman john sousa declined to comment on what he termed speculation about parties to the deal .
enron ' s shares bounced slightly on tuesday after dynegy confirmed the restructuring talks . shares closed up 13 cents at $ 4 . 14 on the new york stock exchange . dynegy ' s shares gained 4 . 2 percent or $ 1 . 64 to $ 40 . 89 on the nyse .
another set of clouds darkening enron ' s sky is the fact that its pursuit of private equity financing has found few takers among the more prominent private equity firms .
three new york - based buyout firms , blackstone group , clayton dubilier & rice and warburg pincus llc have all passed on enron , according to people familiar with enron ' s efforts .
and washington , d . c . - based carlyle group , another major private equity firm , is also not interested in enron , carlyle spokesman chris ullman said .
some private equity executives who have looked at enron say too much remains unclear about enron ' s financial condition to commit funds in the near future .
one certainty is that layoffs are in enron ' s future . three sources confirmed to reuters that enron ' s equity trading unit is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off . an enron spokesman would not comment on the cuts .
those layoffs , part of broader job cuts expected as part of the dynegy buyout , point to an acute problem for enron - the loss of volume in its trading franchise , the crown jewel most coveted by dynegy . enron ' s trading partners have been cutting back transactions with north america ' s largest energy trader because of credit concerns .
"" this business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth . it is the principal reason that dynegy is making the deal . if it ' s worth a lot less , then enron is worth less . it ' s vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business , "" said commerzbank analyst andre meade .

new negotiations for dynegy purchase of enron sends shares higher

houston ( ap ) - the high - profile deal to merge energy marketers enron corp . and dynegy inc . has gone back to the drawing board .
meanwhile , enron reportedly has made progress securing more than dlrs 1 . 5 billion in new cash to keep its business stable while it renegotiates with dynegy .
in a move that sent enron shares higher after days of double - digit declines , dynegy confirmed tuesday that it is in talks to renegotiate its dlrs 9 billion deal to buy its larger but financially troubled rival .
the disclosure that the two companies are revisiting the terms sent enron shares up 2 . 5 percent , apparently easing some investors ' concerns that the deal would fall through .
"" there are discussions occurring related to the structure of the transaction , "" said dynegy spokesman steve stengel , who declined to elaborate .
while news that the two houston - based companies were renegotiating temporarily appeased investors , observers said they won ' t be confident about the deal ' s future until they hear details about new cash infusions to help keep enron afloat .
"" putting more money into the deal to shore up enron ' s credit situation , that would be a sign that dynegy would be committed to the deal going through , "" said mike heim , an analyst with a . g . edwards & sons .
late tuesday , the financial times of london reported on its web site that a new consortium of investors is proposing making a dlrs 1 billion equity investment in enron , citing a person close to the talks . the newspaper didn ' t identify these investors , but said an agreement could be announced as soon as wednesday .
separately , the wall street journal reported on its web site that j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . ' s citibank , which are advising on the dynegy buyout , have agreed to invest dlrs 500 million in the merged company and have said they would consider increasing that amount if they fail to find additional outside investors to take part in the deal .
the journal , citing people close to the discussions , also said dynegy and enron have tentatively agreed to cut the value of the all - stock deal in half . under a deal informally agreed to by enron ' s board , enron shareholders would get 0 . 12 dynegy share for each enron share held .
that would value enron at dlrs 4 . 17 billion . the original deal , valued at dlrs 9 . 3 billion , was based on an exchange rate of 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share .
as a condition of the reduced price , enron executives were seeking more control of the combined company , the journal said .
raymond james analyst jon kyle cartwright said the buyout will hinge on dynegy ' s ability to reinvigorate enron ' s trading operation , which has been hurt as some energy companies have stopped selling it power and natural gas for fear they won ' t be paid .
many energy traders who have shied away from doing business with enron worry that the company will go bankrupt , said charlie sanchez , energy markets manager for gelber & associates , a houston - based energy trading firm .
restoring customer and investor faith "" is not impossible . but it ' s more of an issue of gradually rebuilding ( enron ' s ) confidence and legacy and developing confidence in the new legacy under dynegy . it ' s just going to take time , "" he said .
but fadel gheit , an analyst with fahnestock & co . inc . said enron is a bad investment and that dynegy underestimated its potential liabilities after it announced nov . 9 that it would buy the company at a price valuing enron at about dlrs 10 per share . under the terms of the deal , dynegy also would assume dlrs 13 billion in enron debt .
"" chasing enron is like trying to catch a falling knife , "" gheit wrote tuesday in a research note to investors .
stengel , the dynegy spokesman , declined comment when asked if an announcement of renegotiated terms is expected soon . enron spokesman vance meyer said the company had no comment about any discussions related to the merger and that enron expected the deal to be completed .
in trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares rose 10 cents to close at dlrs 4 . 11 - a stark contrast to trading a day earlier that saw enron shares dip to an all - time low of dlrs 3 . 76 before closing down 15 percent at dlrs 4 . 01 . dynegy shares rose dlrs 1 . 64 to dlrs 40 . 89 on the nyse .
enron ' s stock has plummeted more than 95 percent from its february 52 - week high of dlrs 84 . 87 , after a series of disclosures relating to the company ' s complicated finances raised concerns about its financial viability .
enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allowed the company to keep about half a billion in debt off its books and allowed the executives to profit from the arrangements . enron ' s dealings with those partnerships are now the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation .
the company ousted its top financial officer in october , and several weeks ago restated its earnings back to 1997 - eliminating more than dlrs 580 million in reported income .

usa : enron woes bite into its energy trading .
by james jelter
11 / 27 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
san francisco , nov 27 ( reuters ) - former energy trading giant enron ' s financial straits and plunging share price are drying up its core business as other market players seek out safer trading partners .
while most u . s . utilities and trading houses say they are still striking deals with enron , they also admit now to slashing their financial exposure to the battered company .
"" we haven ' t stopped trading with enron , "" said terry francisco , a spokesman for rival duke energy .
"" we will continue to closely monitor the situation and make prudent adjustments when necessary in accordance with our credit policies , "" he added .
for enron , those policies are starting to sting .
the company has seen its credit rating cut to just above "" junk "" status following disclosure of off - balance sheet dealings by a senior officer and a downward revision of its earnings for the past four years .
enron , which until recently handled 20 percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market , has seen its share price plummet from a year high of $ 84 . 88 to close today at a mere $ 4 . 14 on the new york stock exchange .
cross - town rival dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron in a stock deal valued at $ 10 . 55 a share .
but given enron shares ' continued slump , dynegy said tuesday it was seeking to renegotiate the deal .
dearth of sellers
amid all this bad news , energy traders said they were now reluctant to sell energy to enron .
this , in turn , has raised concerns enron might have a hard time securing enough power and gas to meet its long - term sales commitments , though there so far has been no evidence it has missed any deliveries or failed to pay for what it buys .
nevertheless , mirant corp . , another of the nation ' s top energy trading houses , confirmed tuesday it was no longer willing to sell energy products to enron .
"" right now , we ' re just purchasing from them , "" mirant spokesman chuck griffin said .
this cautionary approach was also confirmed at several municipal and federal power companies , including the mighty bonneville power administration ( bpa ) in portland , oregon .
"" we have severely limited our business with enron , "" said stephen oliver , vice president of power marketing for bpa , which sells wholesale electricity from a string of huge dams along the northwest ' s columbia river .
oliver said bpa , which has done business with enron for six years , owes the company money but he declined to say how much .
"" we have zeroed out their credit limit , and any business going forward with enron would be within the amount of money owed to them , "" he said .
payment up front
enron ' s shaky financial status has prompted some traders to demand payment up front , a move taken by the western area power administration ( wapa ) , which markets hydroelectricity from 56 federal dams for the u . s . department of energy .
wapa spokeswoman laverne kyriss said some of their regional offices have halted spot market dealings with enron and are seeking to renegotiate a 10 - year deal to buy power from enron .
"" we are working to protect our utility customers and the federal government , "" kyriss said .
traders throughout the utility industry said they had curbed or dropped long - term trades with enron , which involve deals lasting anywhere from a week to several years .
as enron ' s financial woes deepen , traders said they are searching for "" sleeves "" , or middlemen , to provide a financial buffer in brokered spot market deals with the company .
in such a deal , a utility , for example , will offer to sell its surplus electricity or gas through a broker , trusting the broker to line up the best anonymous bid in the market .
if the top bidder turns out to be enron , many utilities will turn down the deal unless they have a middleman willing to take ownership and guarantee payment of the energy being sold .
this allows a utility trader to indirectly conduct business with enron while staying within the utility ' s credit limits .
taking a toll
the toll all this is taking on enron ' s business is hard to measure .
enron , like most trading houses , does not disclose its market positions or how much of its activity is wrapped up at any given time in natural gas or electricity - its two biggest markets - or its other energy and financial transactions .
"" we don ' t break things out by type of product , "" enron spokesman eric thode said .
thode said the company had seen a drop in trading volume , about 60 percent of which is conducted over its prized enrononline internet trading system and 40 percent in the over - the - counter market .
but the company ' s 30 - day rolling trade average showed enron was doing about 5 , 400 transactions a day , with a daily notional value of $ 2 . 8 billion , which is well within its daily average of 4 , 700 to 5 , 700 transactions this year .
"" certainly , our volumes have dropped below our 30 - day rolling average . . . but confidence is still being shown by the great majority of our trading partners , "" thode said .

bruce francis , cnnfn anchor , markets impact : well , some on wall street doubt that enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) can survive until the merger . and our next guest is one of them .
kathleen hays , cnnfn anchor , markets impact : brian youngberg is a utilities analyst at edward jones . he ` s joining us now from st . louis . welcome .
brian youngberg , utilities analyst , edward jones : thank you for having
me .
hays : well , we ` re happy to have you here , brian .
but this unhappy situation with enron , this is like a soap opera that just gets worse and worse by the day . and you ` re - - you are
then fairly pessimistic that anything ` s going to come of this .
youngberg : well , i think they may announce some sort of restructuring . you know , the problem i have right now is really the time frame . you know , you ` re
talking of having the company , enron , surviving for another nine months or so on its own . it ` s struggled to survive these last two weeks since the original deal was announced .
so , you
know , dynegy ( url : http : / / www . dynegy . com / ) has to decide , you know , how much more capital they want to put into enron to help shore up the company before they get to closing . so , you know , even if they
do announce a restructuring , it ` s still not a done deal .
francis : could it be clear to dynagy at this point that there are assets at enron that are worth accept - - taking on
all that risk ?
youngberg : well , i think dynagy , you know , has to be evaluating that . you know , the thing they ` re buying here as far as assets is really - - are really the people and the trading
floor . the pipelines they ` re acquiring , which are good pipelines , but they have a lot of debt against them .
so , you know , they have to decide , you know , is this worth continuing to pursue , or let it
go by the wayside and move forward on their own . you know , dynagy in general is viewed as a very solid company , whether or not they acquire enron or not .
hays : so - - and i guess besides
the debt they would take on , we were just - - casey wian in houston just talking to an attorney who ` s getting all kinds of clients who feel they were betrayed , and obviously
there ` s , you know , legal ramifications . i guess that ` s another liability that dynagy has to assess in whether or not it makes this transaction .
youngberg : right . i think dynagy has already looked at - - you know , they assume that
there will be some significant litigation , you know , issues and losses , possibly , as far as shareholder lawsuits and so forth . and i think they ` ve already built that into it .
the question is , you know , is there something
more out there that we don ` t know , and maybe even dynagy itself doesn ` t know ?
francis : is there another potential acquirer out there , or is dynagy the acquirer of the last resort for ( inaudible ) . . .
youngberg : i really
do believe that dynagy is really the only party that ` s really that interested in enron at this point in time . you know , there ` s just too much hanging over the company right
now with an sec investigation , possible further losses , a declining share in mar - - in energy trading and so forth , liquidity issues .
there ` s just too much for , i think , most other companies to really take on . and if
any company knows the insides of enron , i think it would probably be dynagy at this point in time .
hays : ( inaudible ) , you know , this is - - i can ` t think of anything to offset any of
this , because everything you say , it ` s hard to find an argument against .
in fact , if anything , you ` d think dynagy would be better off to wait until they ` re in bankruptcy proceedings and then buy
whatever pieces of the company are on the block .
francis : or just steal the customers .
hays : yes .
youngberg : well , i think the problem with waiting for them to go into bankruptcy , and dynagy has to weigh this
also , is that you get in that situation , you don ` t know what the bankruptcy judge could decide in those situations . there could be other parties that , you know , partake in the bidding
for the pipelines , for example . you know , they may not get all the assets they really do want .
so they do have to make some very tough decisions . and i think that ` s why they ` re - - they ` ve
taken this past weekend , they ` ve taken at least a couple more days here , and they really want to make sure , you know , their next step is the right one for
them . and , you know , we ` ll just have to wait and see , you know , what comes of this .
you know , our view is , we are recommending individual investors that hold shares of enron to sell , move on . there ` s plenty of
other better companies in the sector that have better track records , better outlooks , and really just overall better fundamentals at this point in time .
francis : brian youngberg , thank you for joining us , we
appreciate it .
youngberg : thank you .

enron board agrees to lower dynegy purchase price , paper says
2001 - 11 - 27 23 : 43 ( new york )
houston , nov . 27 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s board agreed to
a reduced dynegy inc . purchase offer that values the energy
trader ' s equity at $ 4 . 17 billion , less than half of the original
price , the wall street journal reported , citing a personal
familiar with the plan .
the new exchange ratio of 0 . 12 share of dynegy for each enron
share would value enron at $ 4 . 91 a share , the journal said . that ' s
19 percent above enron ' s closing stock price today and down from
the original ratio of 0 . 2685 . the agreement isn ' t final , the paper
said .
enron and dynegy executives are trying to save the
transaction amid growing concern about enron ' s cash - flow problems .
enron shares have fallen 95 percent this year as investors
questioned whether the company was using affiliated partnerships
to hide losses and debt , and some lenders stopped providing enron
with cash .
in exchange for a lower purchase price , some at enron are
seeking more control over the combined company , the journal said .
dynegy is prepared to invest at least $ 500 million in enron ,
on top of the $ 1 . 5 billion in cash from dynegy investor
chevrontexaco corp . , the new york times said , citing executives
close to the talks . dynegy wants the cash backed by assets , and
the companies are having a hard time finding enough enron holdings
that aren ' t already mortgaged to creditors , the paper said .
enron finding it harder to trade , competitors say ( update 2 )
2001 - 11 - 27 19 : 32 ( new york )
enron finding it harder to trade , competitors say ( update 2 )
( adds magnum hunter comment in 21 st - 23 rd paragraphs . )
houston , nov . 27 , ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is finding it
harder to buy natural gas or power because some trading partners
have lost confidence the company will have the cash to pay bills ,
spokesmen for other energy companies say .
mirant corp . traders won ' t sell natural gas or power to
enron , though the atlanta - based energy trader will buy from the
company , said james peters , mirant spokesman . aquila inc . ' s
business with enron also is ` ` all on the buy side , ' ' said al
butkus , an aquila spokesman .
dynegy is in talks to lower the price of its acquisition of
enron from its current $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt . the
talks are a sign that the trading operations , which provide more
than 90 percent of enron ' s revenue , are in trouble , analysts say .
` ` if they are renegotiating , it confirms our fears that
enron ' s crown jewel - - its marketing and trading business - - is
deteriorating , ' ' said andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank
securities .
enron spokesman eric thode said enron ' s trading operations
remain strong . volume on enrononline , the company ' s internet - based
trading site , has averaged 5 , 400 transactions a day with a value
of $ 2 . 8 billion over the last 30 days . enrononline handles about
60 percent of the company ' s trading business , thode said .
paying higher premiums
companies that continue to do business with enron are forcing
it to pay premium prices , said arthur gelber , president of gelber
& associates corp . in houston , which advises 18 producers on their
trading strategies .
companies are charging enron about $ 1 . 72 for a million
british thermal units of natural gas , where they would charge a
buyer with better credit $ 1 . 70 , gelber said .
profit margins on energy sales are slim , and ` ` it ' s very
difficult ' ' for enron ' s traders to turn a profit if they have to
pay more than competitors , gelber said .
other sellers are requiring enron to provide large letters of
credit showing it has the cash to complete a deal , gelber said . a
typical natural gas deal , such as a delivery of 10 billion british
thermal units a day for a month , might require a letter of credit
for as much as $ 690 , 000 .
competitors don ' t face some of the problems that enron does
guaranteeing trades , analysts said , because they have their own
power plants and natural gas supplies to meet commitments . enron
has few such assets , and must purchase most of its supplies .
` ` we ' re seeing the repercussion of enron ' s strategy that had
been so unorthodox - - for them to not rely on physical generation
assets , ' ' said will mcnamara , director of electric industry
analysts at consultant scientech inc .
` ` because they don ' t have their own assets to rely on ,
they ' ve got to go out and get the power from somebody else , ' '
which is becoming more difficult and expensive because of the
company ' s credit problems , mcnamara said .
lowering exposure
some partners have long - term contracts with enron and don ' t
want it to fail until they can find alternative suppliers or hedge
existing contracts , traders say .
` ` most people want enron to survive for a certain amount of
time to get their exposure down , ' ' said mike loya , president of
vitol sa , a closely held energy company with offices in houston .
` ` we continue to trade with enron cautiously . ' '
companies that are buying from enron may be doing so to
offset agreements to sell back to the company later , a technique
for reducing the potential losses if a partner fails to meet its
obligations , traders said .
shares declined
enron shares have fallen 95 percent this year as the
investors questioned whether the company was using affiliated
partnerships to hide losses and debt , and some lenders stopped
providing enron with cash .
enron shares rose 13 cents to $ 4 . 14 today , down from a high
of $ 84 . 63 on dec . 28 . dynegy rose $ 1 . 64 to $ 40 . 89 , down 4 . 3
percent from nov . 9 when the merger was announced . shares of
chevrontexaco , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , rose 42 cents to
$ 85 . 62 .
in october , the company said shareholder equity was lowered
by $ 1 . 2 billion because it used stock to pay off a partnership ' s
debt . on nov . 8 , the company lowered earnings back to 1997 by $ 586
million to reflect losses incurred by the partnerships .
last week , enron said it may be forced to pay a $ 690 million
note owed by one of the partnerships and may write off $ 700
million in the fourth quarter to reflect a debt it is backing for
another partnership with stock .
debt
enron is trying to renegotiate more than $ 9 billion in debt
payments owed before the end of 2002 , as well as secure as much as
$ 2 billion from outside investors who will take a stake in the
company . without more money , enron may run short of cash it needs
to guarantee trades , analysts say .
credit concerns prompted magnum hunter resources inc . , an oil
and natural gas producer in irving , texas , to stop selling gas to
enron from the largest producing property it controls in the gulf
of mexico .
the company is still selling gas to enron from two smaller
properties , with the purchases backed by letters of credit ,
because enron was one of the few companies willing to give small
companies credit a few years ago , when oil and gas prices were
low .
` ` we have always appreciated them standing by us when
commodity prices were low , ' ' said magnum hunter chief financial
officer chris tong .
some large industrial natural gas and electricity users are
avoiding signing long - term contracts with enron , industry
consultants said .
` ` why would you go with a supplier where there ' s uncertainty ,
when you can go with one where there ' s certainty ? ' ' asked mark
boyer , chief operating officer of summit energy services inc . in
louisville , kentucky , which advises metals , chemical and paper
companies on their energy - purchasing decisions .

i know you ' re busy with bid week , so here are a couple questions & comments
for you :
september
i need to know if a ticket has been set up for september for the market side
of the williams & apache gas . we still only the supply is in mops . if it
just needs points added to it , just let me know the deal ticket # .
august 31 st
this was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on
lonestar 1023 & 1460 . currently , they do not have the supply points needed
for the williams & apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to
imbalance . . . so i will get them added so this gas can be pathed .
july 31 - aug 7
these days were pathed as buy / sells from tenaska iv to tenaska marketing
ventures .
i worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment ( july &
aug business ) , and had them do a manual entry for aug 31 st .
please let me know what you think when you get a chance .

"Subject: fw : section 311
just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case .
- - - - - original message - - - - -
from : hull , bryan
sent : tuesday , august 14 , 2001 7 : 16 am
to : redmond , brian
subject : fw : section 311
brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . .
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .",0

the judge opined that very large refunds would be due - "" while the amount of such refunds is not $ 8 . 9 billion as claimed by the state of california , they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars , probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum . ? at the same time , while there are vast sums due for overcharges , there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso , the investor owned utilities , and the state of california . can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller ? the chief judge thinks not . "" another notable quote : "" ? it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated . ""
the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5 , which was summarily rejected by the state of california , and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected .
refund effective date - refund effective date of october 2 , 2000 , for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px . the chief judge ' s recommendations do not go beyond that date . "" spot market "" sales are "" sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery . ""
evidentiary hearing - "" the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact . the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes . thus , the chief judge recommends that a trial - type , evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below . because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60 - day fast track schedule . it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding . however , such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot markets in an after - the - fact refund calculation . in any event , sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period . ""
methodology - the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june 19 th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october 2 , 2000 through may 28 , 2001 .
heat rate - the actual heat rates , rather than hypothetical heat rates ( associated with recreating the must - bid requirement of the june 19 th order ) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit .
gas cost - the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price . "" in the event that the marginal unit is located in npl 5 ( north of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for pg & e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . if the marginal unit is located in spl 5 ( south of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . the daily spot gas prices should be for the "" midpoint "" as published in financial times energy ' s "" gas daily "" publication for the aforementioned delivery points . the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published ( weekends and holidays ) . ""
o & m adder - an adder of $ 6 / mwh for o & m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price .
emissions costs - demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation .
credit adder - the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january 5 , 2001 when pg & e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy .
ancillary services - consistent with the june 19 th order , ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real - time imbalance energy market . adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june 19 th order .
maximum price for non - emergency hours - somewhat unclear . the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds , the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 % non - emergency requirement of the june 19 th order . to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price , every hour should be recalculated .
offsets - "" recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period . amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated . any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period . ""
interest - interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller .",0

hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

"Subject: ferc gives guardian favorable preliminary determination
ferc gives high sign to wi pipe competition
the northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin gas transportation
markets , which long have been dominated by
anr pipeline , moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline - on - pipeline
competition yesterday when ferc awarded
the proposed guardian pipeline llc a favorable preliminary
determination on non - environmental issues .
the decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline
because not only did it shoot down most of the
arguments presented by anr to thwart the project , but it found that
even though the project would "" adversely
affect "" landowner interests , guardian was making "" reasonable efforts ""
to mitigate the impact on landowners .
moreover , ferc ruled that while the $ 224 million pipeline would compete
head - to - head with anr , it would not
have a negative affect on the coastal pipeline and its customers . "" on
balance , the commission finds that the
proposed guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits
with minimal adverse impacts , "" the order said
[ cpo 0 - 36 ] .
the commission also found that sufficient need was established for the
36 - inch , 140 - mile pipeline that would
transport 750 , 000 dth / d of gas from the chicago hub to markets in
northern illinois and southern wisconsin ,
providing customers there with an alternative to anr and access to
competitive canadian gas supplies . it would
terminate near ixonia , wi , where it would interconnect with wisconsin
gas co . ' s distribution system . at the
chicago hub , the pipeline proposes to interconnect to alliance
pipeline , northern border pipeline , midwestern gas
pipeline and natural gas pipeline co . of america .
guardian has executed 10 - year precedent agreements with four shippers
for 702 , 500 dth / d , which equals about
94 % of the project ' s design capacity . the largest shipper by far will
be wisconsin gas , which has committed itself
to 650 , 000 dth / d of the capacity on the proposed line . in fact , the
guardian project is an outgrowth of wisconsin
gas ' s request for proposals ( rfp ) process in june 1998 , which the ldc
initiated in anticipation of the expiration of
its firm transportation contract with anr in october 2003 . the other
shippers on guardian include alliant energy
( 10 , 000 dth / d ) , wps energy services inc . ( 2 , 500 dth / d ) and an unnamed
shipper ( 40 , 000 dth / d ) . the project has a
targeted in - service date of nov . 1 , 2002 .
in multiple protests filed at the commission , anr argued that
guardian ' s application was "" patently deficient ""
because it didn ' t include the proposed lateral that wisconsin gas plans
to build to interconnect with guardian .
wisconsin gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to
build the lateral . furthermore , anr claimed
wisconsin gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised ldc serving
southern wisconsin to subsidize the
guardian project . wisconsin gas ' s parent , wicor inc . , is one of the
sponsors of guardian . the other backers are
cms gas transmission and storage and viking gas transmission .
but ferc rejected both arguments . "" while previous attempts to inject
competition into anr ' s market in this area
have failed , we believe that this area is ripe for competition , and
that it is only a matter of time before other
pipelines submit similar proposals to the commission . we find that the
proposed project will provide southeastern
wisconsin with access to another source of supply , which will allow
this market to enjoy the benefits of
pipeline - to - pipeline competition for the first time , "" the order noted .",0

kindest attention ,
i want to use this means of communication because of time shortage , please

his death on the 30 jan 2003 , in the kenya airways flight with registration

my father secretly called me and disclosed to me that he deposited the
sum of usd $ 21 . 5 million , in a vault box and deposit it as family valuables , in
a security company in london . the security company does not know

he placed my name as next of kin , and also gave the documents pertaining
the consignment to me . he also explained that i should seek for a foreign
partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and
use it to invest in a profitable ventures , ( such as real estatemanagement ) .

ami ,
sorry that i haven ' t followed up yet , but we are in the middle of
implementing sap ( which i ' m sure
you have heard about ) , and haven ' t had time to put the sample report
together .
what i have at
present is a report from our scada system that must be run manually each day ,
to get a report of
yesterday ' s volumes , beginning and ending at 7 : 00 a . m . the problem is , until
i
can revise it , the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers , and i need to
create a new one with only the
hpl stations . i also want to set it up for automatic creation , to run at
approx . 8 : 00 a . m . daily . it would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board , such as
is
currently being operated
by george perrine . i will be coordinating this effort with george in that
regard . until i have completed the
entire task , however , i will try to send you a daily ( 5 days per week ) report
created manually , showing the
previous day ' s volumes for our monitored hpl stations . i am shooting for
starting this tomorrow .
i have also been discussing this with royal edmondson of our gas supply
dept . , and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information
between
all interested parties . he
will be getting back with you on this .",0

my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london .
we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate
this process .
of course , anjam will be very unhappy about it , but we cannot manage around
him
any longer .
i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase .
i would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility .
a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market .
we see the market for technical people going through the roof in
practically every location
where we operate .
a contract is not a good solution in my view . it creates a sense of false
security for
both an employee and the company .

hi vince ,
hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a
noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to
pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant
recruiting effort for credit trading and research .
i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and
keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :
1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not
sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token
salary increase .
2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for
making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to
ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy
and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at
year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater
responsibility .
3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )
contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of
these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .
we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer
to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually
binding him to the job .
i ' d value your thoughts on this .
thanks ,
dale",0
"Subject: edison mission energy
this project , of all that have been proposed recently , probably has a better
chance of success . first , mission energy is already a huge player in the
ipp / cogen business in kern county , and is regarded as fairly skilled at
getting permits / authorizations through the system . their existing facilites
on texaco ' s leases currently produce over 1 , 000 mw of power . secondly , this
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the midway - sunset field and is
easily accessible off the west side lateral of kern / mojave ' s system . as
such , they are probably a prime candidate for either phase i or phase ii of
kern river ' s expansion . also , realize that texaco has a substantial amount
of field area [ associated oil ] gas , so , depending on the structure of the
texaco - mission energy sales agreement , mission probably has access to or
call on this texaco production ( i . e . , they have the perfect physical hedge ) .
kern would seem to be the "" pipeline of choice "" here . . . particularly , when you
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion .
without the direct connection into kern county , tw would have a difficult
time competing . also , keep an eye out for el paso moving forward with
commercial plans for the california leg of all american pipeline . a large
end - use plant like this could be the basis for an "" en - rate "" type transport
program on el paso - all american , particularly if they get their allocation

2003 .
final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for phase i of the

"Subject: pep for jean mrha
i regret to decline to review jean . i went through the form for her but was not able to provide nearly enough meaningful feedback to justify . i have worked a lot with jean over time , but mostly indirectly this period . we have had occasional interaction ( a couple brief meetings and a couple phone conversations ) about the development and status of the wellhead book . in addition , she did attend one of the inter - departmental wellhead book meetings that i hosted and we have collaborated on analysts / associates , but i have not really worked closely with her this period . she may feel that we have worked more together that we have based on the time i have spent with john grass and others related to the wellhead book , but my direct interaction with her has been minimal .
on the positive side , she has been very helpful by identifying good analysts / associates for me . she thinks highly of gas structuring as a rotation opportunity and she is one of my best advocates with the analysts / associates . she worked with me to let me take kelli little ( assoc ) when some of the deals she was working on were put on hold . furthermore , she has forwarded resumes and / or had individuals contact me several times this period .
on the negative side , i am not sure why she seemingly let john grass struggle so long in the development of the wellhead book . i know she championed the idea and sold the idea to the office of the chair , but from my perspective she gave the ball to john and turned her attention too quickly to other opportunities . the wellhead book is john ' s responsibility , but it ultimately rests with her . with john ' s relatively short time in ena and his lack of network , she could have aided in giving him more direction and support from the outset . to her credit she seems more engaged lately , especially with the producer 1 initiative .
i hope that helps . i would be happy to answer any questions you may have or discuss further as necessary .

changes to the manual list for north america need to be authorized by wes and

i think that what we need to do is immediately address the issues that are

mary , larry and wes ,
we just received a faxed copy of the manual wire and same day payment memo
which was sent by betty tauzier on 8 / 28 / 00 .
rate & currency trades fx which is settled the following day and requires
next day payments for fx . currently we are severely hampered because our
infomation is required into unify by 2 : 30 for an accounts payable run at 4 : 00
for next day payments . we are still trading after these cut - offs and tying
out the day ' s activity with trading . therefore , we currently have to rely on
manual wires to make payments to our counterparties on the value date .
we need to get timeframes which mirror our business requirements . i would
like to get the accounts payable run for our companies , 842 and 967 , moved to
after 5 : 00 pm . information is not due to the bank until next day . 8 : 00 am
london time .
please let laurel and me know what changes can be done to our processing

subject : pserc iab - who we are
one of the things i would like to accomplish over the next few weeks is for
we iab members to build a better working relationship . there have been many
changes to pserc over the past year , as well as many new iab members
joining with their universities . i ' ve felt that i don ' t know most of the
iab members and that makes it difficult for me to feel like i ' m adequately
representing your needs to the pserc executive committee . i hope to meet
many of you in denver and get to know you better , but i think we all need
to know each other better . i have an idea that might help us and it will
only take five minutes of your time .
if you could take the time to fill out the following short questionnaire
and email it back to me then i ' ll compile a list and distribute it to you .
depending upon when you respond i might be able to hand it out in denver ,
but i ' ll be sure to email you a copy later if i have to . this is , of
course , perfectly voluntary , so if you ' re not interested its okay . if you
want to respond via a telephone call , i ' m at 607 - 762 - 8825 .
email this back to me at sjdemarco @ nyseg . com and copy dennis ray at
djray @ engr . wisc . edu .

you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to
$ 100 .
you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise
gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes
on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is
28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against
ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .
of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option
position
as an offset .
the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have
income in the
future ( or capital gains ) .
not so good .
by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem .

subject : short - sell vs exercise
below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it
explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised
but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call
option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the
ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good
article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )
- chonawee
short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options
in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when
you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in
fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never
reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or
until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold
on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your
exercise .
however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of
exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that
amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,
you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on
the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the
options to cover your short position anytime .
let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,
and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as
follow
if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,
you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no
matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover
the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of
short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can
cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your
options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still
keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the
only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your
short position .",0

the following table summarizes the pv quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the navy yard . you may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates ( unitized ) on the value of the transaction . because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price , an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal .

ect or enron to the ect external address book :
at this point i need to skip down to the jones ' in the list , so i just type
jones and a quick search dialogue box appears . click ok and i go to the first

"Subject: enronoptions - your stock option program
it is amazing and yet not surprising how much enron has accomplished in the
first six months of this year . you continue to make it happen . we recognize
that you work hard every day to accomplish enron  , s business goals , and we are
pleased that many of you have shared in the company  , s financial success
through enron stock options .
as you may know , the current employee stock option program ( also known as the
all employee stock option program or aesop ) began in 1994 and provided value
to participants through 2000 . employees who have participated in this
program from its inception have realized a 1 , 119 % increase in the value of
their stock options ( assuming a stock price of $ 70 ) over the life of the
program .
enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package
and a contributing factor to your performance and to enron  , s continued
success . therefore , the enron executive committee and the compensation and
management development committee of the enron board of directors have decided
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package .
on may 1 , 2000 , the committee approved an employee stock option program for
calendar years 2001 - 2005 ( enronoptions  ) your stock option program ) . it is
expected that enronoptions  ) your stock option program will be granted ,
effective on or about december 29 , 2000 , for those employees who are eligible
on that date ( please see note below ) . the new program , which is subject to
final approval by enron  , s board of directors , is as follows :
? enronoptions  ) your stock option program will give stock options to
eligible full - time and part - time regular employees in domestic and
international companies / locations .
? the grant of non - qualified stock options will equal 25 % of annual base
salary ( 5 % of annual base salary for each year of a 5 - year period ) on
december 29 , 2000 . ( salary calculation and value may vary in some
international locations . )
? the board will grant the stock options on december 29 , 2000 .
? eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant
of stock options .
why commit your talent and energy to enron ? enronoptions  ) your stock option
program , among other good reasons  ( that  , s why .
in the coming weeks , you will be receiving more details about enronoptions  )
your stock option program . to provide information and answer your questions ,
we will introduce a special link on the human resources web - site , host
several espeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular
basis . in the meantime , if you have immediate questions , please contact your
human resources representative .
note : in addition to final approval by enron  , s board of directors , granting
of options will be subject to new york stock exchange and state and federal
regulatory requirements . it is expected that enronoptions  ) your stock
option program will be available to most enron employees ; however , some enron
companies  , employees may not be eligible due to legal , accounting , tax , labor
or business issues . as you know , enron changes to meet the needs of the
marketplaces we serve . given that need to change , we will continue to refine
the eligibility for enronoptions  ) your stock option program and will
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being
determined on december 29 , 2000 .",0

"Subject: sddp model
john ,
attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the
developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor
of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is :
www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and
contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls
are possible .
development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare
the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in
central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs
on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc .
while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around
1994 .
the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of
from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power
systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks ,
so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle
thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m
not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the
model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic
dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water
value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a
number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would
operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode
of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model .
most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission
constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine
bus nodal prices .
a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files .

"Subject: re : factor loadings for primary curves
tanya ,
i went through the comparisons for the liquids curves and the
appearance of clear parallel shifts , etc , do begin to emerge when fewer
forward prices are used . it looks sensible . i have passed the graphs over
to the liquids people , and i have asked them to identify rough term structure
months when illiquidity begins for these curves . it might coincide with your
assumptions . i am surprised by brent and dubai , which should be wti - clones .

subject : re : factor loadings for primary curves
naveen & vlady ,
jin yu finished debugging the vatrfacs code and now it calculates factor
loadings for every "" primary "" curve ( except power curves ) .
i am sending you the calculated factors :
most of them don ' t look good . 60 forward prices were used in calculations for
each commodity .
i reran the code using fewer forward prices depending on the commodity
( 12 prices for c 3 gc , mtbe , nc 4 , so 2 ,
17 prices for nxho , 18 - for sa ,
24 for c 2 gc , lax _ jfk , ,
30 - for condensate , dubaicrude , brent , ,
48 for nsw , semichem - risi )
these results are in
most of them look much better .
please , review .
we will have to add a column in rms _ main _ curve _ list to specify how many
forward prices we want to use for each commodity ,
and then use the new factors in the var model .

conoco has nominated 5 . 0 / d at this meter . conoco transport can be allocated
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
exceed 5 . 0 mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter .
hpl may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why i

sold 20 , 000 mmbtu / d of daily firm space moving gas for the weekend from pg & e
topock to socal needles at $ . 10 / mmbtu . this was somewhat of a novel deal in
that the california price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at pg & e .
once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational , this opportunity
will likely dry up .
enron n . a .
representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation
in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on navajo land near
farmington , nm . third party developers approached ena looking for assistance
in moving the project forward .
new tariff services
marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of
transwestern ' s hourly firm service until the potential markets of power plant
loads become operational . during this interim period , park ' n ride services
provided on an intra - day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than park
' n ride services provided on a timely basis . any resulting market response
will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates
for hourly transportation service .
el paso
el paso merchant services needs to re - scrub their verbal offer to
transwestern of a $ 15 million lump sum "" pre - payment "" option of fuel
monetization for their combined 65 , 000 mmbtu / d of san juan to california
capacity . el paso did not take into consideration the different termination
dates of the two contracts ( 25 , 000 mmbtu / d pg & e permanent release contract ,
and 40 , 000 mmbtu / d gallup expansion contract ) in their analysis . a revised
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid - next week .
el paso field services
met with ep representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near wt - 1 .
the i / c would be sized for 40 , 000 mmbtu / d . ep proposes to pay for and set
compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a
volume commitment of 20 , 000 mmbtu / d for up to 2 years . an added advantage is
most of the volume would come from the constrained atoka area which would
allow agave to increase deliveries to tw .
caithness corp .
caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 mw generation project in
northwest arizona . the 2 - phase project would initially consume 80 , 000
mmbtu / d of gas . the proposed location is 40 miles south of tw ' s line near
wickieup , az . we are meeting with caithness reps next week . projected
in - service date for the plant is early 2002 .
wt - 2 cooler expansion
level b cost estimates are being prepared . revenue / cost savings
assumptions predict $ 500 , 000 annual revenue to support the expenditure . once
installed , the project would give tw an additional 50 , 000 mmbtu / d capacity on
the east end . financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is
received .
ngpl winkler interconnect
ngpl notified us this week the reactivated point should be operationally
ready to flow gas on july 17 ( about 2 weeks ahead of schedule ) . this will
hopefully provide new system supply to tw ' s east end of about 80 -

case study guidelines
1 . model should be for a particular market . examples : pjm , chicago , ecar ,
southern california . lb ( optional ) . model should be for a particular purpose . examples : valuing a
new combustion turbine at the florida / georgia border , bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in nepool , valuing a retail portfolio in
pennsylvania .
2 . model should be estimated on a particular data set . examples : daily
nymex
close prices for palo verde , pjm hourly spot prices for 1998 - 1999 .
3 . case study should describe several candidate models , for volatility
and / or market price , that were considered . case study should discuss why
these models were considered . candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally .
4 . evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified , and quantified to the extent possible . examples of evaluation
criteria : residuals that are not autorcorrelated , stationarity , r - squared ,
akaike information criterion .
5 . parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed . the
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described .
6 . some diagnostics of model fit ( vis - a - vis data set ) should be presented .
7 . if possible , predictive power of model should be assessed .
generally , the case study should include all of the items above . the case
study may include other things .",0

a few more details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . again , most of the ega companies ' ownership trail includes all enron ownership through a number of enron entities . through further research , we found a few more that don ' t totally fit that mold :
elektro - electricidad e servicos s . a . in brazil . . . . 38 % of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by enron entities .
epe - empresa productora de energia ltda in brazil has outside owners including shell and ljm brazilco and interjuris s / c ltda . a . k . a . shell cuiaba holdings owns two shares and has a 1 % direct ownership interest and one board vote .
energia ltd , another brazil operation , is owned by enbras which in turn in owned by enron corp . ( shares of the company are pledged to westdeusche landesbank gironzentrale as of 22 feb . 01 .
again , this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know .

steve :
as stated earlier , many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership .
we can assure you that , for the most part , you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ( i . e . , corp . , ena , ees , etc . ) . there are a few , however , that may be incorrectly categorized , as follows :
ea : ect non u . s . payroll company ( there is no such entity , but i would assume these folks are paid by ena )
enron capital & trade resources in london , uk ( may actually be enron europe company called enron capital & trade resources limited )
ebs : broadband solutions pvt . ltd . ( actually comes up to corp . through a long complicated chain of companies associated with atlantic commercial finance )
eeos : enron engineering & construction and the former nepco are both organized under eeso whose ownership remains enron corp .
the nepco in the uk could actually be nepco europe ltd . whose ownership is tied to enron europe .
ees : enron direct ltd partnership is actually an enron north america entity
the others are either ees or bundled under ees even though they are thought of as enron facilities services / limbach companies
ega : here ' s where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these enron global assets entities have very complicated organization structures with
complicated , multi - layers structures that eventually lead back to enron corp . ownership . as you know all of the old subsets ( i . e . apachi , calme , etc . ) have
gone away and everything international is now ega . to the best of our knowledge , all of these entities and their employees are enron managed .
following are the exceptions and / or unusual organizational structure that should be noted :
electricidad enron de guatemala s . a . actually reports up through ena
san juan gas company , inc . in puerto rico is a direct sub of enron corp . ( 100 % owned )
enron american del sur , s . a . is an enron corp . / enron transportation services entity
no entity called enron singapore . . . . more than likely enron capital
no enron wind uk , no enron wind india . . . . but regardless , they are all part of the ewc / erec family .
global these entities all are a part of enron global exploration & production , inc . , which is owned by enron corp . , but one has indirect outside ownership .
ep : enron oil & gas india ltd . , for instance , is owned by enron asst holdings , which is owned by enron finance partners , which is part of a complex ownership
structure that includes one non - enron entity ( zephyrus investments , llc ) with a small interest .
again , i hope this information is helpful . for the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track . let my group know if we can be of additional assistance .

- connecticut call center person will answer any help desk calls , which will then be transferred here .
- connecticut call center will send pa faxes in accordance with instructions from here .
- cover letter will have ubs letterhead , but will be unsigned and will specify connecticut numbers
- splash page will be modified to show connecticut numbers
- once we reach closing date , the numbers will be permanently forwarded to here .
- all future correspondence ( and the bulk mailings ) will specify the houston number

powerisk 2001
the global premier forumforenergy trading & risk management
6 th - 9 th november 2001 , paris
dear mr kaminski ,
i am responsible for the programme of this year ' s powerisk conference in paris . helyette geman has informed me that she has contacted you concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her again this year - brilliant !
i would like to know if you are also interested in delivering a paper again . the audience in previous years greatly appreciated your contribution , and i would me more than happy if you could join us again .
to give you an idea of the programme so far , these are the ( "" technical "" ) topics that are already covered :
chris strickland : forward curve models with jumps for the pricing of exotic energy contracts
multi - factor forward curve models for the valuation of energy contracts
adding jumps
applying the models to exotic energy options
extensions to multiple energy contracts

structures of gas supply agreements ( gsa )
relationships between physical and virtual power stations ( pps / vps )

peter nance , principal , teknecon : combining power systems and monte carlo simulations for effective pricing
dan mansfeld , head of risk control , vattenfall : assessing the benefits and risks of using derivatives as part of your risk management strategy
spyros maragos : analysing new approaches to building forward curves from available market data

helyette geman : pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured contracts
please let me know if you are interested in joining the powerisk 2001 speaker panel , and which topic you would like to cover . i think that something along the lines of last year ' s talk ( state - of - the - art volatility and correlation estimation techniques for multiple energy portfolios ) would be brilliant again , but please feel free to chose something else that has not been covered yet .
i look forward to hearing from you ,
kind regards ,

"Subject: transatlantic meetings
to the executive committee :
attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off - site and team - building meetings . my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get - togethers that require substantial travel . our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time - consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize . often , participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees ( especially if they are outside of texas ) . naturally , they may feel that this time of year ( prc time ) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering .
these off - sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter , which compounds the difficulty ; worse still are the times they occur at the end of q 2 , since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process .
i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs ( both direct and indirect ) when inviting international employees to off - site meetings in the us . we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations , but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses .
thanks !
john sherriff
( letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports )
we still have issues regarding offsites and ' team building ' exercises . in particular , we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending .
in order to avoid misunderstandings , and to increase transparency , the following will apply with immediate effect :
any offsite or ' team building ' exercise which any group ( both commercial and non - commercial , and including john and myself ) intends to undertake must be communicated , in advance , to all department heads . issue to be identified include : all participants who will out of the office , total costs of the exercise ; and , where appropriate , work load coverage details .
john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends . to the extent that is not possible , we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered .
trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved . so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel .
please communicate this policy to your staff .

"Subject: sap timesheets
hello everyone :
thanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to
save everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with
the time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical
order
by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .
the spreadsheet is saved in o : \\ research \\ common \\ sap timesheets \\ mmm - dd .
( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time
period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered
for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type
in
your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save
it .
if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and
show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,
family
time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes
have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the
spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever
applies .
if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time
or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked
and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .
there is no code for non - exempt overtime .
this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to
fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will
try and remind you by email the day before .
i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any
other
off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket
for any
reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your
timesheet for you .
if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .
thanks !

on january 12 , i hosted a brainstorming session at the four seasons hotel in
downtown houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry . to complete a
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture , we are hosting an
integrated design session facilitated by cap gemini ernst & young ( cgey ) at
their accelerated solutions environment in dallas , texas .
i am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this design
session . this is a critical two - day event to be held february 12 th and 13 th
in dallas , texas . this work session is based on a unique approach called a
designshop  v . it is a very focused , activity - driven event that is composed of
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups . if you
have not attended one of the designshops related to sap , you will likely
regard this session as different from any working session you have previously
experienced . the prior designshops held in conjunction with sap have proven
to be very successful . therefore , we have elected to utilize this same
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture .
a limited number of representatives from enron will be attending . you were
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in the
designshop . you are being asked to participate in the full two days with as
little distraction or interruption as possible . the quality of our results
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the
entire event . additionally , you will be relied on in the future to support
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session .
this date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods so
that your participation can be maximized . therefore , please make all
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during
these two days .
please review the attached information regarding hotel , flight information ,
and transportation . preliminary information as to schedule and environment
has also been included . you may direct any additional questions concerning
the event to mary solmonson at ( 713 ) - 853 - 6079 .
i hope that you will be able to participate . please confirm your attendance
for the two days with marvia jefferson at 713 - 853 - 9165 by january 29 th 5 : 00
p . m . if you are unable to attend , it may be appropriate to select someone
else to participate . please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to
take your place until you and i have discussed this .
i thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing you
in dallas !",0

we know how interested all of you are in the retention & severance plan , so we want to update you on its status .
as many of you know , we have been working with members of the creditors ' committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention & severance plan , and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday , february 22 . we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month .
we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention & severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave . we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed . we ' re learning that , in bankruptcy , most things don ' t move as quickly as we are accustomed .
the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan , but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns . the creditors ' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention & severance plan . such plans align the company ' s objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy . these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate .
the creditors ' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process . to that end , we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee . we intend to work hand - in - hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible . this is currently our top priority , bar none !
when we filed for bankruptcy , we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be . unfortunately , that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place .
we now know that it takes significant time , resources and effort to understand , identify and gather the massive volume of required details , to formulate that information into a reasonable program , and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation . the process mirrors the most time - intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved . that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse .
we remain committed to working with the creditors ' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan . we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so , and have targeted the week of march 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court . we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court .
with respect to non - debtor companies , or those companies not in bankruptcy , new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future .
in the meantime , we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week .
and of course , we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible .",0

to all -
as you may already know , the short term west hourly desk began trading the enron online hourly market on monday . these deals should be treated just like all short term west hourly deals - they do not need to be confirmed . unfortunately , it seems the eol application created for us is defaulting to "" yes - confirm , "" and west hourly deals are being pulled into your batches of confirmation letters .
i ' ve spoken with the eol help desk about changing this default setting , and they ' ve informed me that it may take a day or two to make that change . in the meantime , i wanted to make you aware of these deals ' existence . you will be seeing larger numbers of trades from the short term west hourly desk in the future , and many of these will be made on eol . again , these should be treated as with any other west hourly deal and do not need to be confirmed .
please let me know if you have any questions about this . i ' ll let you know as soon as i ' ve heard more conclusive information from eol . and thanks for your help .

we can talk about it at 10 : 00 am , however , i do not think the split will work as you propose . the vast majority of the industrial process load uses more than 25 mw on peak which is and should continue to be the focus of ena . the target companies and sites we will focus on down here will average somewhere in the 10 - 20 mw peak range ( remember , non - process load , aggregation of sites ) .
after ees bought back the minority shareholders , there has been increasing overlap in the marketplace between ees / ena . the reasoning behind deliniating where and how each group will focus was to alleviate the external overlap , reduce any friction between the groups , and increase both groups productivity .

sponsor a speaking engagement where one of the speakers ' topics would be

you are a saint for lending me a copy of your book . i agree with you that we
don ' t want increase there revenues even by a $ 1 . 00 , although my
recommendation ( and mark palmer ' s as well ) is that we should pursue a
rebuttal for the following reasons :
as i mentioned i scoured the internet ( britannica . com , amazon . com , yahoo . com
and dow jones ) and could not find one mention of the book , therefore mr .
mehta ' s distribution must not be wide at all . consequently , his comments may
not have reached a large audience . issuing a rebuttal , may in fact , draw
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving .
i believe we should proceed with caution , and respond accordingly ( with
counter comments ) only when comments are solicited from us . so far , we have
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to mr . mehta ' s
enron bashing . may be we should ' leave the stones unturned ' .
let me know what you think . also , please contact me when it is convenient
for me to borrow the book from you .

our dhabol operation is a stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",0

"Subject: do supplemental energy bids matter ?
bill , chris ,
i think this is the market notice you two were refering to . yes , caiso will use the lower of sc - submitted bids or a unit ' s proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the mcp of supplemental energy and a / s . however , my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and a / s . if you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your unit ' s proxy costs ( and are willing to justify them ) , you should bid your higher - than - proxy costs . if you are accepted , you are supposed to be paid as bid .

sally asked that i forward the detail of the "" killed "" eol transactions to
both of you . we have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers
that a deal transacted via enrononline is a binding / legal transaction , but we
have continued to see a few of these deals occur . in summary , we have had a
total of 33 killed transactions since inception , the majority of which have
been with aquila ( 5 ) , koch ( 8 ) , and internal trades ( 13 ) . obviously , the
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties , and
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not
appearing on the customer ' s summary report . it is important to stress to the
commercial team that the way to "" get out of a trade "" is to do an offsetting
trade or have our legal dept prepare a termination agreement . please feel
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to
work with legal in the case of a terminated deal .

richard et al
under the new electricity trading arrangments ( neta ) in the uk and looking
forward i think it will be increasingly important in modelling market
behaviour and transmission related costs to have some form of system model
incorporating opf and atc .
therefore , in principle i am happy to support option 3 and to pay a 1 / 3 share
of the cost . however , before i commit to this particular package , i would
like to be comfortable that the generic powerworld software could be suitably
customised to capture the special features of neta .
i understand marco verreschi who initiated interest from our end is pursuing
this with martin lin ( research , houston ) . however , due to commitments next
week , and my desire to see powerworld in action etc it is likely to be the

vince ,
we have three options to increase our availability across enron for the power
world load flow software .
option 1 , upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only . price
$ 9 , 990 . 00
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows , but not
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity ( atc ) because only the
optimal power flow ( opf ) version can perform that task .
option 2 , site license for the load flow and purchase 1 opf package for
walter coffer ' s group . price $ 11 , 240 .
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows and one other
group the ability to determine marginal cost and atc .
option 3 , site license for load flows , opf and atc . price $ 14 , 990 . 00
this would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows , marginal
cost , and atc .

ok , i believe we have a consensus .
if i understand correctly our posting period for this capacity expires on monday at 5 p . m .
you should accumulate service requests for the capacity until that time . tie bids will be decided by a lottery .
if shippers ask you can explain to them that since this is newly posted capacity , we ' re posting it until 5 p . m . monday and will not award capacity until that time , and if requests for service exceed available capacity we ' ll award it based on the procedures in section 13 of the fts - 1 rate schedule .

per our previous decisions , we have utilized the provisions of section 13 for purposes of allocating capacity . therefore i agree with maria , that we would need to conduct a lottery if there are tie bids . i also agree that the reference to fcfs in section 1 is meaningless and should be eliminated . i would guess that that was there from inception , and has just been a non event . mary , put on clean up log . mk

subject : tw posting question - - urgent
importance : high
conoco did not exercise its right of first refusal on 20 , 000 of capacity on tw so it has gone back out on our ebb yesterday .
mindful of our posting guidelines for newly available capacity ( i . e . 5 days before we sell for a year or more , 3 days before we sell it for a term of 5 months - lyear , 1 day if we are going to sell it for 5 months or less ) , assume the following scenario :
march 19 : capacity is posted
march 21 : shipper a calls one of our marketers and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
march 22 : shipper b calls and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
march 23 : posting period ends ( assuming of course that the capacity got posted at 9 a . m . on march 19 )
questions : who gets the capacity ? what do we tell shippers a and b ?
we could say "" first come first served , "" but our tariff specifically states that we will not maintain a queue .
is the better answer that we accumulate service requests until the close of the posting period , then have a lottery ?
please let me know your comments . we need a consensus asap - - before we get that first offer . thanks .",0

title : california ' s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase
url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2241
california  , s desperate attempts to avoid a rate increase
on february 1 , 2001 , the california assembly approved and the california
governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for california .
the
legislature has been meeting since early january in a  & special extraordinary
session  8 to address the power market crisis in the state , and the new law
represents their first significant piece of legislation . the bill , ab 1 ,
establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state  , s businesses
and
consumers . whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the
limited revenue source used to pay for the power  * collected by the state  , s
investor - owned utilities ( ious ) under current retail rates  * will cover
wholesale
power market costs incurred by the state . the law reflects the obsession by
california lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the
underlying flaws in california  , s market structure .
ab 1 ushers in several important changes to the california market structure .
it
also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the
state . highlights of the bill include
* power buying authority transferred . the responsibility for purchasing power
for the customers of california  , s ious has been transferred to the california
department of water resources ( cdwr ) . the california utilities will continue
to
operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts . the
difference between the utilities  , total load and the sum of their resources
( referred to as the utilities  ,  & net short  8 amount ) will be supplied by cdwr ,
an
amount of energy that varies between 5 , 000 and 25 , 000 megawatts ( mw ) ,
depending
on the time of year , time of day , and utility plant availability . the
utilities
most recently performed this function themselves , buying energy from the
california power exchange ( px ) . however , cdwr has been buying electricity on
behalf of the ious since mid - january , when the near - bankruptcy of southern
california edison ( sce ) and pacific gas & electric ( pg & e ) threatened to
disrupt
supplies to their customers . cdwr is a state agency that manages water
reservoirs and transportation systems in the state . cdwr uses an enormous
amount of electricity to transport water across california and provides
critical load - shedding capability to the independent system operator ( iso ) . in
addition , cdwr  , s reservoirs generate power . the cdwr is thus well integrated
in
the state  , s electric grid but in the past has not executed large , complicated
energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of california  , s
utilities .
* portfolio of transactions . the intent of ab 1 is to allow cdwr to execute a
portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and
their customers . cdwr has until january 2 , 2003 , to execute contracts . cdwr
will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse . it
has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms , including monthly ,
annual , two - year , three - year , and longer . cdwr may also enter into options .
thus , although cdwr  , s role is intended to be temporary , the contracts that it
executes could extend many years .
* power for munis . cdwr may purchase power on behalf of some california
municipal utilities at the municipal utilities  , election .
* new payment scheme . cdwr will be entitled to a portion of existing utility
rates to pay for the cost of purchased power , interest on bonds , and
administrative expenses . this payment stream will be equal to the difference
between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates
( averaging about $ 0 . 07 per kilowatt - hour kwh ) and the utilities  ,
costs to run
their own generation plants , costs of bilateral and qualifying facility
contracts , and the costs of ancillary services . the cdwr share of retail rates
is referred to as the california purchase adjustment ( cpa ) . it is not clear
whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs . current prices for
multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa . in addition , if investors
believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs , the entire program may be
abandoned .
* new bonds . bonds will be issued to secure power . the total amount of bonds
issued may not exceed four times the cpa . the state will transfer $ 500 million
from the general fund to jump - start the program , which begins immediately .
this
seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the california
utilities  , customers ( and municipal utilities if they opt in ) .
* new residential rate freeze . the california public utilities commission
( cpuc ) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it has
completed paying all outstanding obligations . this locks in the recent 9
percent residential rate increase indefinitely . governor gray davis thus keeps
his pledge not to increase rates further .
* retail competition . to help secure a stable payment stream for the new
bonds ,
ab 1 enables the cpuc to prohibit the utilities  , retail customers from
choosing
an alternative electricity provider until cdwr  , s obligations are paid .
although
the cpuc has yet to act on this , the action would effectively halt the
competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr program .
* taxpayer protection . ab 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state  &
neither
the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california is
pledged
to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond .  8 thus , the bonds
are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates .
* no assets affected . the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of
utility assets .
ironically , the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had
essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity
prices by executing a portfolio of transactions . the utilities were never
provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts . in addition , the
utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr .
rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices ,
california
has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing
function . sce and pg & e are still left to contend with uncollected costs from
past energy purchases , although they will no longer incur costs associated
with
buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail
rates . the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved .
it is not clear whether the law  , s prohibition on rate increases for
residential
customers can be achieved . the law is silent on rate increases for commercial
and industrial customers , providing a potential path for recovering
higher - than -
expected costs . alternatively , cdwr could conceivably find contracts of
sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met . these
contracts would lock in today  , s retail rates for a long period of time .
ab 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power
system in california to a more stable footing . key tasks remain .
* california  , s wholesale market structure , which helped cause the supply
crisis
by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in
california , remains unchanged . the term contracts cdwr is likely to sign will
provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will
not
be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities . in
addition ,
california  , s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged .
* the state must still address the need to expedite the development of new
power plants .
* ab 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale energy
costs of california  , s utilities . the state has been negotiating a deal with
the
utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission assets
to
the state . however , the utilities have achieved recent court victories that
may
pave the way to a court - directed recovery of these costs . recent audits
indicate that sce and pg & e recovered their stranded costs early in 2000 , which
should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes . a legal
showdown
between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable .

"Subject: eia ' s latest forecast of pricing and supply for the winter
eia predicts supply shortfall will linger through winter
the energy information administration said yesterday in its september
short - term energy outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead
will increase by about 87 % this winter ( october - march ) compared to last
winter . residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27 %
compared to last year . for the entire year , the average wellhead price for
natural gas is projected to be $ 3 . 40 / mcf , the highest annual wellhead price
on record ( in inflation - adjusted terms , it would be the highest annual
average price since 1985 ) .
the short - term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry ' s
ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are
likely to continue into the heating season , eia said . storage levels could
end up being about 8 % below the five - year average of about 3 , 000 bcf by the
start of winter if net injections continue at 10 % below historically average
rates through the remainder of the refill season .
the effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the
form of significantly increased production until after the next heating
season , according to the agency ' s report .
"" for now , we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible
increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001 , with assumed
increases of 0 . 5 % and 1 % , respectively , for this year and next . . . , "" the eia
report stated . "" on the other hand , the u . s . natural gas rig count on aug . 25
was at a recent high of 794 rigs . exploration and production budgets for many
natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001 ,
spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues
from producing assets . also on the positive side , data from the texas
railroad commission suggest that , through may , year 2000 gas production
increased , if only slightly ( 0 . 4 % ) . this signifies a turnaround ( however
modest ) in a key producing region . very high gas drilling rates , including a
record - setting pace in deep offshore gulf of mexico , confirm that
increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way . ""
imports are projected to rise by about 12 % next year primarily because of the
1 . 35 bcf / d alliance pipeline coming on line next month .
meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4 . 2 % annual growth . in 2001 ,
however , the forecast has been revised downward to 2 . 5 % growth because of
higher than expected natural gas prices . the industrial sector is the leading
sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9 . 3 % , while electric utility demand is
expected to decline by 4 . 0 % primarily because of power plant sales . for the
power generation sector as a whole , gas demand is expected to grow 6 . 5 % this
year and 1 . 5 % in 2001 . eia said the reduced growth rate next year is largely
due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas , which
began in august , with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices
continued to rise .
gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5 . 7 % compared to last winter
if weather is normal . normal weather implies a 12 % rise in heating
degree - days compared with last winter .",0

vince ,
while i was at hsb , i designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model
that hsb uses for new product development , pricing different reinsurance
strategies , computing stochastic earnings forecast , and estimating
probabilistic maintenance & repair costs . the code , written in visual basic &
ms access belongs to hsb , and i want to replicate it here for our use at
enron . i would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps
vasant who was briefed on the model , about how we can use your group for the
analytical and programming support to get this model re - constructed .
i have screen outputs from the code and vasant thought the re - design and
construction here at enron is a problem that your group can do . could you let

daren :
i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .

2 . discount all gossip . responsibility will be put on many groups and many groups will claim responsibility . there are no facts at this time .
3 . nonetheless , there are a limited number of terrorist groups that could coordinate an attack with this many targets and this level of sophisticaton . indeed , it is likely that a state sponsor of some kind would be required to provide financial and intelligence support for such an attack .
4 . it is virtually certain that these groups or countries are based in the middle east . it is almost equally certain that a massive us response against a middle eastern target is forthcoming . there will be enormous domestic political pressure on the bush administration for a vengeance attack . this will be at least partially offset by a reluctance to further inflame arab radicalism in the middle east and persian gulf .

i have talked to alex about it . i don ' t think that the additional seminars

crowd out the brown bag lunches .
the seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and

for most members of the group it should be the piece of cake . brown bag

are not that time intensive , except for the speaker .

we had about 15 lectures , given by the following people :
grant , stinston , vasant , krishna , zimin , maureen , clayton , paulo , chonawee ,
myself , and
some outside speakers . we were able to attract some outside audience as well .
overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned
to continue it .
in light of the presently scheduled seminars on "" energy derivatives "" , it
seems our friday
schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on "" energy derivatives "" on
two fridays
and fbblop on other fridays . what ' s your suggestion ? should we discontinue
the fbblop ?
we also have scheduled january 19 for tom halliburton ' s visitor leon lasdon

"Subject: option p & l
gentleman :
the erms system , as you know , has an excellent capability for
decomposing option p & l into the following components :
new deals
curve shift
gamma
vega
theta
rho
drift
2 nd order adjustments
what i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars .
the unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position
is being associated with specific prices . these prices are the effective buy
or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position .
stated differently , the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price
variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma ' s
standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs . this is something i dont
understand . to date , inquiries to the risk management accounting group has
further revealed that the gamma component of p & l is not well understood .
this is what concerns me : bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures ( nymex
and gas daily ) . both books dynamically hedged its positions during
yesterdays large price move and , through anticipitory hedging in advance or
during the large price move , secured sufficient coverage to neutralize
expected changes in delta . however , our p & l from our underlying position did
not offset our gamma p & l . consequently , i have to ask why ? im hoping that a
brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which
will better guide our hedging decisions .
any help is appreciated",0

"Subject: insightful media article on california power prices
mark golden is an excellent reporter covering the power scene .
our takeaways :
* power prices are declining in california as the "" destruction of demand ""
effect of higher retail power prices kicks in .
* the long - term power contracts signed by the various power producers and
energy merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them , as evidence of
price weakness ( from a base of extremely high prices ) is beginning to
develop .
* the movement in prices in california is reflective of the message in our
power curve 4 report , where we show that forward prices are peaking this
summer . year / year power price comparisons are now projected to be flat
4 q : 01 , and declining afterwards .

power points : great news ! long - term contracts jeopardized
by mark golden
a dow jones newswires column
new york ( dow jones ) - - those looking for even the slightest bit of good
news
for the state of california can find it in friday ' s san jose mercury news .
"" california is in danger of losing more than 40 % of the power it has lined
up in
long - term contracts , "" says the lead of a major article , because republicans
in
the state legislature didn ' t back the $ 12 . 5 billion bond deal last week .
getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen
to
california in a long time .
since the state went on its long - term buying binge , forward prices for
power
in the western u . s . have been falling steadily . gov . gray davis announced
$ 43
billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on march 5 . contracts for summer
power at palo verde , ariz . , a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of
power
into california , have fallen to $ 390 a megawatt - hour from a high of $ 600 / mwh
in
late march . further out , power for 2004 - 2006 at mid - columbia river , a key
trading hub north of california , has fallen from $ 58 / mwh in february to
$ 49 / mwh
today .
companies like calpine corp . ( cpn ) and dynegy ( dyn ) that took advantage of
the
state ' s buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy . in fact , they have
affectionately started calling the governor gravy days . enron corp . ( ene ) ,
which
has been selling aggressively for two months , according to traders , is
looking
like a genius as usual . generators that held out , like reliant energy ( rei )
and
duke energy ( duk ) , may be sorry that they did .
it ' s been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious
pain
in the markets , but that time has come . power generators may not make as
much
profit this summer as last , and power traders that have taken long
speculative
positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought them . as was
seen
in the eastern u . s . power markets last summer , long positions can turn out
just
as painful as short positions .
for california , the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this
summer
won ' t be as bad as once expected . the bad news is that the state government
is
by far the biggest "" long "" in the bearish forward market . it ' s safe to say
that
the $ 43 billion in contracts signed in march have declined in value by 15 % ,
or
$ 6 . 5 billion . that ' s almost as big of a financial disaster going forward as
everything that has gone on since last summer until now .
granted , this is a sort of damned - if - you - do - damned - if - you - don ' t situation .
barring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years
of
deregulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in u . s .
history . california should do some forward purchasing now , and it ' s such a
behemoth that it will move the market up when it does so . and , when it gets
done
buying , prices will come down simply because it stopped .
but that ' s a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the
energy
crisis . early this year , when the state started down the path of
mega - purchasing , there was no shortage of advice not to do so . long - term
prices
were embedded with too much of today ' s supply - demand imbalance . the state
would
have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first - since it would
have
to do that anyway - and gradually securing forward power as declining prices
reflected the improving situation .
since then , the state has done a great job of crushing demand . electric
usage
is already down 9 % from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation
efforts and a slowing economy , and people haven ' t even seen their 30 % higher
bills yet . similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other
western
states and in natural gas usage nationally . this is likely what has been
behind
much of the downturn in forward power prices in the west .
this column started with a false "" good news "" lead . it would be great for
the
state if , after the state ' s credit rating sinks further , sellers exercised
their
option to tear up the five - and ten - year contracts . but they won ' t do that .
the
prices are too good from the sellers ' perspective . calpine , which has signed
three such contracts for the state , said immediately that it has no
intention of
reneging on its agreements . and gary ackerman , director of the sellers '
association , told the mercury news that he didn ' t expect power companies in
general to back out of the deals .
but there may be some real good news for california . the davis
administration
hired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading
to
purchase billions of dollars of power . perhaps they are quick learners . this
week presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it
needs -
summer power for this year only - on sale . low prices in the daily market
monday
and tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to $ 325 / mwh , which is
cheap by
recent standards . the contract price moved up to $ 390 / mwh , but the state
took
advantage of the opportunity while the window was open .
"" the week ' s condition in the market place helped . we were able to procure
some
energy for june through september , "" said state spokesman oscar hidalgo .
and , hey , there were no blackouts this week .

fyi . this could be quite important for us . through forming a tradinf co . we
could be brokering deals on behalf of mseb , without letting them off the hook .
in this manner we could be doing short term deals and increasing despatch
from dabhol or other mseb marginal units . any money flowing from these sales
should go into an escrow account that goes directly towards payment of dpc
bills .
in this manner we would be increasing the payment ability of mseb .

subject : power trading
wade : the group of ministers on foreign investment had decided to recommend
foreign equity participation upto 100 % for trading in power sector , subject
to prevailing laws . however , they left the final decision to the union
cabinet . it is understood that a note supporting the recommendation of gom is
being put up for consideration of union cabinet . since power minister is
willing to support the proposal and industry minister is already ok with such
proposals , i don ' t anticipate any problem at the cabinet level . let us wait
and watch the developments .

louise :
a termination of equipment associated with the longview project on or before 10 / 31 / 01 will require enron to write - off approximately $ 23 million , not inclusive of approximately $ 3 million in development costs to date .
to extend orders for equipment to 11 / 30 / 01 will cost an additional $ 5 . 3 million in cancellation charges .
to extend orders for equipment to 12 / 31 / 01 will cost an additional $ 8 . 7 million ( inclusive of the $ 5 . 3 million above , therefore , net $ 3 . 4 million ) in cancellation charges .
termination at any time between now and year - end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent .

we are not done . on friday when we were prepared to sign , black hills energy capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent , black hills corp . at noon today they said that the signature was on its way . at 4 : 00 pm we heard that they will issue a l / c instead of the corp guarantee . the l / c approach is fine , but i am concerned with this flaky behavior .
our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with black hills energy capital tonight / tomorrow morning . they would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an l / c for $ 15 mm by thursday . if not , we can terminate at any time prior to close of business monday . i will update when something changes .

"Subject: tw sale / hedge of unsubscribed firm
tw is currently in negotiations with a handful of shippers regarding 3 blocks
of unsubscribed firm capacity :
block one
volume : 27 , 500 mmbtu / d
term : 1 year , 01 / 01 / 02 thru 12 / 31 / 02
receipt : san juan , ignacio or blanco
delivery : california border - not to exceed 13 , 500 mmbtu / d at needles .
price : floating . difference between ngi socal and iferc , epng , san juan
award criteria : adjustment ( + / - ) to floating price
block two
volume : 49 , 000 mmbtu / d
term : 1 year , 01 / 01 / 03 thru 12 / 31 / 03
receipt : san juan , ignacio or blanco
delivery : california border - not to exceed 35 , 000 mmbtu / d at needles .
price : floating . difference between ngi socal and iferc , epng , san juan
award criteria : adjustment ( + / - ) to floating price
block three
volume : 11 , 000 mmbtu / d
term : 2 years , 01 / 01 / 02 thru 12 / 31 / 03
receipt : san juan , ignacio or blanco
delivery : east of thoreau
price : floating . difference between ngi socal and iferc , epng , san juan *
award criteria : adjustment ( + / - ) to floating price
* mismatch between delivery point and pricing location is an attempt to
capture more of the spread value . however , early discussions with shippers
indicates the structure may not be marketable . we may ultimately revert to
selling it on a "" san juan to eot "" basis .
transwestern attempted to impose a deadline for consideration of these blocks
on friday , jan . 5 , in order to bring closure . however , some parties were
not able to comply and will be providing proposals on monday .
if an acceptable offer for one or more of these blocks ( blocks one and two ,
in particular ) is received on monday , then in addition to the preparation of
the physical gas transportation contract , a hedging strategy to lock - in the
spread value should be implemented .
i ' ve spoken with dave neubauer and others ( larry , morgan , vernon and theresa )
regarding the execution of an appropriate risk management strategy . in
particular , i spoke with morgan about hedging the basis risk by executing
fixed / floating price swaps at the receipt and delivery ends . we ' ve already
talked with the potential shippers about using ngi socal at the california
border and iferc , epng , san juan for receipts . these indices appear to be
the most liquid with respect to trading the paper . they are also highly
correlated to physical prices at the receipt and delivery locations off
transwestern .
if the physical transport deals are completed on monday , i believe we should
move to execute derivative instruments to hedge the basis spread .
indications from counterparties earlier in the week are showing about a $ 1 . 40
spread in ' 02 and $ 0 . 90 in ' 03 . however , given the current state of the gas
market , and after consulting with steve harris , i also believe we should
leave the price risk open on the fuel collection under these contracts . it
seems imprudent at this point to lock - in fuel gas prices that are at
historically high levels .
i ' ve attempted to at least "" tee - up "" the requisite paperwork that will
document the physical transaction , hedge transaction and attempted hedge
strategy . i ' ve included it below for your use if a hedge is indeed put on
for these pending transactions . please feel free to modify or to make such
changes as you see necessary .
i ' ll be in washington d . c . on monday and tuesday . i ' ll have my cell phone
with me and will be checking messages also . call if you have questions .",0

london - - bg group plc extended its reach in the indian subcontinent and expanded its exploration and production portfolio with the purchase of the offshore indian assets of u . s . energy group enron corp . for $ 388 million ( 422 million euros ) .
analysts applauded the purchase by the u . k . oil and gas company , saying it is acquiring some promising assets inexpensively . the price works out to less than $ 2 . 30 per barrel of oil equivalent , given the proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of enron oil & gas india ltd . "" we value other indian oil and gas reserves at $ 2 . 90 ( assuming an oil price of $ 18 ) , so bg appears to have paid a good price , "" said abn amro in a research note .
a bombay - based energy analyst reckoned enron "" probably undersold , "" noting that earlier this year indian state - owned oil & natural gas corp . , a partner of enron ' s indian unit , had its $ 400 million offer for the assets rejected .
enron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in india , and is attempting to exit the controversial dabhol power project , india ' s largest private power plant , in which it has a 65 % controlling stake .
the indian unit ' s assets comprise a 30 % stake in the tapti gas field and the panna / mukta oil and gas field , and a 62 . 64 % interest in the cb - os / 1 exploration license in the gulf of cambay off western india . the enron unit is the designated operator of these developments .
equity production from the fields amounts to 20 , 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day , representing about 6 % to 7 % of bg ' s total output . for the year ended march 31 , enron ' s indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $ 60 million on revenue of $ 160 million .
the acquisition complements bg ' s fledgling refining and marketing interests in india , which include holdings in western indian distributors gujarat gas co . ( 65 % ) and mahanagar gas ( 50 % ) . it is also the driving force behind a project to pipe liquefied natural gas from iran to tap india ' s growing appetite for gas .

bg , the gas and oil group , has stepped up its efforts to develop india into one of its core markets with the $ 388 m ( # 262 m ) purchase of assets owned by enron , the us energy and trading group .
the deal is the latest sign of enron ' s retreat from the region , and comes as the group is separately attempting to withdraw from the $ 2 . 8 bn dabhol power plant following a payment dispute with maharashtra state .
bg is placing particular emphasis on developing markets .
it has operated in india for 10 years but has so far concentrated on gas distribution through a 65 per cent interest in gujarat gas company and a joint venture with the gas authority of india in mumbai .
david mcmanus , bg executive vice - president responsible for eastern hemisphere business , said the transaction would give it the opportunity to develop the indian gas market . the company has a view to creating demand for imported liquefied natural gas through bg ' s planned pipavav lng terminal in gujarat .
"" india has the second fastest - growing gas market after china and we see it as a core place to use our expertise , "" he said .
the agreement is subject to confirmation from enron ' s partners that bg will be able to take over operating the fields , and consent from the indian government .
analysts said the acquisition was a logical next step for bg and appeared good value against market expectations of a $ 600 m price for the assets .
iain reid of ubs warburg said : "" either bg are extremely good negotiators or there is an element of risk attached to the speed at which production can be increased . ""

"" there was a real nice tone to the market today , "" said pat davis , head of nasdaq trading at ubs warburg , said . "" but i don ' t think you can say we ' ve heard all the bad news we ' re going to hear .
over the past three weeks , wall street analysts had been systematically reducing their earnings projections to better reflect the deterioration in economic conditions . only over the past several days had they begun to focus on valuations , saying that , in some instances , stock prices looked attractive , even projecting weaker earnings .
lehman brothers , for example , jumped to the defense of some software names , and a number of those marked improvement . shares of peoplesoft gained 3 . 14 , or 15 % , to 23 . 68 on the nasdaq , a 50 % improvement over its sept . 27 52 - week low of 15 . 78 . bmc software added 74 cents , or 5 . 8 % , to 13 . 60 .
a number of storage - products makers marked sharp improvements , after dain rauscher wessels insisted high - quality names in the sector would be able to realize earnings targets . mcdata , for example , rose 2 . 11 , or 26 % , to 10 . 15 , while qlogic shot up 5 . 89 , or 33 % , to 23 . 96 , both on the nasdaq .

british natural gas company bg group has struck a deal to buy enron corp . ' s offshore oil and natural gas properties in india for $ 388 million in cash , the companies said wednesday .
these properties are the last of the oil - and gas - producing properties houston - based enron retained after it spun off enron oil & gas , now named eog resources .
the deal marks another step for houston - based enron away from owning large physical assets . the company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities .
it is "" another significant step for enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses , "" the company said in a written statement .
enron ' s other assets for sale in india include the controversial dabhol power project , india ' s largest private power plant , in which enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake .
reports surfaced wednesday that enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $ 3 billion project at a discount . analysts have said for months now that enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer . tata power co . , india ' s largest private electricity firm , has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over dabhol .
the oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the tapti natural gas field and the panna / mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of mumbai and a 62 . 6 percent interest in the offshore block cb - os / 1 exploration license . all are on the west coast of india .
production from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8 , 200 barrels of oil per day . reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent . bg paid about $ 2 . 30 per barrel of oil equivalent .
the other partners in the tapti and panna / mukta offshore operations are oil and natural gas corp . , which holds 40 percent , and reliance industries , with a 30 percent stake . the other partners in the cb - os / 1 license are hindustan oil exploration co . , with 17 . 36 percent , tata petrodyne with 10 percent , and oil and natural gas corp . with 10 percent .
enron acquired its natural gas reserves in india with an eye to using them as fuel in the dabhol plant .
in august , houston - based enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in dabhol for no less than $ 1 billion , an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project .
dabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . it was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on india ' s west coast in june after the board stopped buying power .
john ambler , enron spokesman , would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the dabhol project , but said the company favors selling its stake .
"" we continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of india and / or indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant , "" ambler said . "" we are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs . ""
the shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2 , 184 megawatts .
other partners in dabhol include general electric and the bechtel construction firm , which each own 10 percent .
the remaining 15 percent is held by the maharashtra state electricity board , the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located .
bg ' s existing interests in india include holdings in western indian natural gas distributors gujarat gas co . and mahanagar gas . the company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from iran via pipeline into india .
india ' s gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years , while its gas production is declining .
edison rates to remain high under utility ' s deal with state
by karen gaudette
associated press writer
10 / 04 / 2001
associated press newswires
copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
san francisco ( ap ) - consumer advocates warn that southern california edison customers , already saddled with last spring ' s record rate increase until 2003 , could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead .
the deal secretly negotiated with the state public utilities commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by edison last november and is designed to keep the utility from following pacific gas and electric , the state ' s largest utility , into bankruptcy .
it lets edison pay off more than $ 3 billion of a $ 3 . 9 billion debt , in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last may for at least the next two years .
consumer advocates , however , said wednesday that other consequences of the state ' s power crisis could send rates higher still .
the state ' s power - buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $ 43 billion of long - term power already contracted for delivery .
the prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some edison customers .
"" we can ' t stay in business , "" said william ho , general manager of top hat cleaners in west hollywood , where the monthly electric bill has gone from $ 600 before the state ' s energy crisis to nearly $ 1 , 200 . "" we would have to raise prices , and we ' re already heading into a recession . ""
ho said top hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows . but he added , "" you can ' t press clothes in the dark . ""
it ' s unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power - buying costs , said nettie hoge , executive director of the utility reform network , a san francisco - based consumer advocacy group .
hoge and other consumer advocates said this week ' s deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of edison , which supported the state ' s failed deregulation plan .
"" it ' s like saying i ' m not going to beat you any harder , so it shouldn ' t hurt , "" she said .
john bryson , edison international president and chief executive officer , said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors .
edison owes nearly $ 4 billion to hundreds of power companies , ranging from energy marketing giant enron corp . to the state independent system operator , manager of the state ' s power grid .
"" the agreement means stability , predictability , "" he said during a conference call with reporters wednesday . "" it means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work . ""
the puc said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power - buyer . commission president loretta lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy .
"" i think that this is a balanced compromise , but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt , "" she said .
the state department of water resources so far has spent $ 9 billion buying electricity for customers of edison , pacific gas and electric co . and san diego gas and electric co .
the shareholder - owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers . the state ' s 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers .
that price cap was the focal point of edison ' s lawsuit against the puc , with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers .
under the deal struck this week , edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $ 1 . 2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt . the utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators , and that money also would have to help pay down the debt .
the agreement now goes before u . s . district court judge ronald s . w . lew in los angeles , who could rule on it this week .
"" right now judge lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers . . . . will he pull out $ 3 . 3 billion for edison or will he protect the working men and women of california who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax ? "" said douglas heller of the santa monica - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights , which organized a protest rally wednesday outside the federal courthouse in los angeles .
heller estimated the settlement could cost edison ratepayers $ 750 each over the next four years .

bg pays enron pounds 263 m for indian oil and gas

bg is to buy enron ' s oil and gas assets off india ' s west coast for $ 388 m ( pounds 263 m ) in a move that will make the uk - based oil and gas producer the largest foreign investor in the country ' s upstream energy market .
the deal will add 5 per cent to bg ' s total output , with 19 , 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day , of which 60 per cent is gas . according to david mcmanus , bg ' s executive vice president , it will be earnings accretive from day one . "" there is currently a deficit between the supply of gas , which is currently all indigenous gas , and the need for gas within india , "" mr mcmanus said .
some analysts see demand doubling over the next 10 years , making india one of the world ' s fastest - growing energy markets .
the assets being sold by the us group enron include a 30 per cent stake in the tapti field and the panna mukta field north - west of bombay .
bg shares closed down 2 . 5 p at 261 p in a mixed oil sector after the news . mark redway , an analyst at teather & greenwood , said : "" the logic is good and they ' re paying quite a low multiple at six or seven times last year ' s earnings , but [ after the 11 september attacks in the us ] there ' s a lot of investor nervousness at the moment over exposure to this part of the world .

new delhi , oct . 3 . bg india has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire enron ' s offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $ 388 million .
the contract signed on tuesday night with enron oil and gas india ltd involves purchase of the latter ' s 30 per cent stake in the tapti gas field and the panna - mukta gas / oil fields besides the 62 . 64 per cent interest in the cb - os / 1 exploration block .
addressing a press conference here on wednesday , mr nigel shaw , bg india chief executive officer , said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeholders agreeing to bg as the operator of the exploration fields .
the rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of oil and natural gas corporation ( ongc ) , a 40 per cent stakeholder in the panna - mukta , tapti fields , besides a 10 per cent stake in the cb - os / 1 exploration block , seeking operatorship of the fields .
when contacted , the ongc chairman , mr subir raha , said , "" ongc ' s position remains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields . we are currently in talks with bg on the issue . ""
"" we are in talks with the government as well as ongc on the issue . we are not contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied , ""
mr shaw replied when queried on the issue . he stressed that in case the other parties do not agree , the deal will fall through . "" we will walk away in such an event , "" he said .
on the legality of ongc ' s claim , mr shaw said , "" under the agreement , at the point of change of control ( from enron to bg ) , the other stakeholders can object to the transfer of operatorship ( to bg ) . however , the contract is not clear on the deadlock . ""
mr shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end of the month .
currently , in the tapti and panna - mukta gas fields , reliance industries ltd holds 30 per cent stake while ongc holds 40 per cent equity . in the case of the cb - os / 1 exploration field , hindustan oil and exploration company holds 17 . 36 per cent , tata petrodyne 10 per cent and ongc 10 per cent .
the bg vision : bg plans to double the gas production capacity of the tapti gas fields by 2004 , according to mr shaw . though not willing to reveal the quantum of investment in the future , he said that bg would be committed to its share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on cb - os / 1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in december .
"" there is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this . ""
bg will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with gas authority of india ltd ( gail ) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset ( exploration field ) . however , the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields . currently , the fields yield 70 million standard cu . feet of gas per day and 8 , 200 barrels of oil per day .
bg has a 50 per cent stake in mahanagar gas ltd , a gas supply company in mumbai . further , it is in the process of setting up an lng regassification terminal in pipavav .
bg is not interested in buying out enron ' s upcoming lng regassification facility at dabhol since it is setting up its own lng regassification terminal at pipavav , gujarat , mr shaw said .
mr shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields , there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the lng terminal and that from the exploration fields .
on the pricing front , the tapti and panna - mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004 . beyond this period , the pricing is internationally linked .
once the deal is completed , bg india plans to initiate talks with reliance industries ltd ( ril ) and ongc to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture , according to mr shaw .
further , it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in london as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum .
bg has so far invested $ 150 million in its ventures in the country .

british gas to buy enron ' s oil , gas assets for $ 388 m

british gas india today announced that it has reached an agreement to buy the assets of enron oil & gas india ltd for $ 388 million . the assets include a 30 per cent interest in the tapti gas field and the panna / mukta oil and gas fields as well as a 62 . 64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the cb - os / 1 block . all three are located on the west coast of india and are operated by enron .
however , british gas india chief executive officer nigel shaw said the deal is subject to the condition that british gas gets operational control of the fields . "" if we are not the operator , we will walk away from the deal , "" he said . the deal , signed in london last night , would require clearance from the indian government . shaw revealed that british gas india has already initiated a dialogue with the government for this .
but the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it has dried . the state - owned oil & natural gas corporation ( ongc ) which has a 40 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by enron oil & gas .
however , petroleum minister ram naik said "" all issues will be sorted out in due course "" . "" enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal . we will examine the issue , "" he said .
according to oil industry sources , the operatorship is based on a consensus _ and not on the percentage of shares held _ among shareholders . the proposed sale of enron ' s assets does not "" mean an automatic transfer of operatorship and the shareholders will have to come to a consensus , "" ongc sources claim .
what is more , ongc had earlier unsuccessfully bid $ 350 million for enron ' s oil and gas assets . ongc has the first right of refusal , according to an ongc official . ongc chairman s raha was unavailable for comment .
shaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of operating the oil and gas fields .
"" we are in active discussion with both ongc and reliance . we are hopeful of wrapping it up by the end of this month , "" shaw said .
an ongc official , however , said the state - owned company was aware of the development but had not been informed officially by enron .
shaw also disclosed that british gas was willing to make further investments to ramp up production at the tapti and the panna / mukta fields .
"" further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree . we are looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004 , "" he said .
when asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise , shaw said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars .
the three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meters of gas and 29 , 000 barrels of oil a day .
an enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a reliance spokesman .
enron oil & gas has 30 per cent interest in the tapti gas and panna / mukta oil and gas field , ongc has a 40 per cent interest and reliance has the remaining 30 per cent .
in the case of cb - os / 1 , the other partners are hindustan oil exploration company with 17 . 36 per cent and tata petrodyne and ongc with 10 per cent each .

sacramento - - in a dramatic escalation of energy crisis rhetoric ,
california atty . gen . bill lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a
houston - based power company should be locked in a prison cell with an
amorous , tattooed inmate named spike .
lockyer , who is investigating whether energy firms have manipulated
prices on the wholesale electricity market , made the comment in an
interview with the wall street journal that appeared tuesday .
"" i would love to personally escort [ enron corp . chairman kenneth ] lay
to an 8 - by - 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says , ' hi
my name is spike , honey , ' "" lockyer said .
enron spokesman mark palmer called the comment "" counterproductive
rhetoric "" that "" does not merit a response . ""
but other industry representatives denounced the remark as
"" outrageous , "" especially because neither lockyer ' s office nor any
investigative panel has filed charges against enron or other companies .
"" you ' d expect that the state ' s chief legal counsel would file charges
first and make public statements second , "" said gary ackerman of the
western power trading forum , an association of energy producers and
traders . "" we ' re very disappointed with his choice of words , which don ' t
exactly fit the profile of his office . ""
in an interview tuesday , lockyer said he decided to "" ratchet up "" the
commentary to "" put [ energy companies ] on notice "" that "" we are not afraid
of them and have the will to prosecute . ""
"" what i ' m trying to do is let these economic buccaneers understand
that if we catch them , they ' re going to be prosecuted , "" lockyer said .
"" just because they ' re multimillionaires and run big corporations , it
doesn ' t provide them with immunity . ""
the attorney general is investigating whether power company officials
tried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on the
wholesale energy market . several panels , including a state senate
committee and the california public utilities commission , are conducting
similar probes .
on tuesday , lockyer announced that three power companies have agreed
to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators . the
attorney general went to court to obtain the documents after the
companies failed to meet a march 19 deadline to hand them over .
lockyer said the forthcoming documents would help his office as it
sifts through mountains of evidence in search of possible violations of
antitrust or unfair business practice laws .
"" evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity , ""
lockyer said . "" but we need to make sure it ' s compelling and clear enough
that you can convince a jury . ""
lockyer said he singled out enron ' s chairman because the houston
company is the world ' s largest energy trader .
at least one observer found lockyer ' s comments refreshingly candid .
harry snyder , a senior advocate of consumers union , said , "" let lockyer be
lockyer . ""

louise ,
no hi how are you doing ? no how is it going up there in portland ? you just come in and go right for the west desk ' s eol jugular .
as everyone knows , the west power desk has a spotty record , at best , on maintaining eol volumes . there are some good reasons for this and some lame , tired excuses which i ' m sure we will discuss in great detail in the near future .
i currently don ' t get the ice reports and will make sure i am on the distribution . from what our traders tell me and what the report that you sent indicates , ice is having an even harder time in the west than we are . it looked like there were two one - month deals on ice that day totalling 20 , 000 mwh . in contrast , we had 87 transactions totalling 269 , 000 mwh . if i ' m reading it right , the ice report actually makes us look good by comparison !

we look at ice volume reports every day and they are doing about 10 - 20 % of the volumes ( and # transactions ) we are doing on eol . we are doing 300 - 350 transactions per day in east power and ice does approx . 45 - 50 transactions per day .

"Subject: re : recent deal
john ,
it is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ets to grant origination for closed deals . on ecf ' s behalf , bilberry and hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded . also , the prc process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a person ' s p & l for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of enron .
the value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of p & l to the overall formosa deal . i do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over $ 50 million to enron . at best , the current value of the closed transaction across egm , ecf and ena is under $ 10 million . in addition , egm did compensate bilberry and hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the teppco contract and incremental transportation volumes from williams .
i certainly hope we can work out this p hilgert , chris
cc : mrha , jean
subject : recent deal
congratulations on closing the deal with formosa , teppco , et al . it sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players .
clean fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with formosa . we will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters ( timing , pressures , volumes , etc ) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary .
you had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal ? that would be very interesting reading and i would appreciate a copy if possible .
thanks again , john goodpasture",0

"Subject: organizational statistics
attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001 . the hr organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population . a few highlights from this report :
the employee base continues to grow ( though on a significantly slower pace than 2000 ) .
terminations ( voluntary and involuntary ) are up dramatically this year .
our "" contribution loss "" ( a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving ) has gone up , indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods . however , those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations ( ebs , the former ee & cc and hpl ) .

subject : re : var correlation scenarios
thanks tanya , these are interesting results . i am on vacation next week , so
here are my current thoughts . i am contactable on my mobile if necessary .
gas to power correlations
i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the
combined gas and power portfolio , and this raises an interesting point : at a
conservative 30 % long term correlation , combined var is olmm less than
previously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach ? strictly
speaking , we are still over our uk power limit , but the limit was set when we
were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var .
a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the uk
gas and power books -
can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in
portfolio var - ie [ reduction = portfolio var - sum ( power var + gas var ) ] ?
also , if i understand your mail correctly , matrix 1 implies 55 % gas power
correlation is consistent with our correlation curves , and this reduces total
var by ol . 8 mm .
efa slot correlations
the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is
a separate issue . i don ' t understand where the matrix 2 efa to efa
correlations come from , but i am happy for you to run some historical
correlations from the forward curves ( use the first 2 years , i would
suggest ) . our original matrix was based on historicals , but the analysis is
worth doing again . your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important
these correlations are .
closing thoughts
friday ' s trading left us longer so i would not expect a limit breach on
monday . we are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve , and i ' d
like to wait until both simon hastings and i are back in the office ( monday
week ) before finalising this .

subject : re : var correlation scenarios
everybody ,
oliver sent us the var number for different correlations for uk - power
portfolio separately from uk - gas portfolio .
first , if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas
curves should not affect var number for power and var number for gas , only
the aggregate number will be affected . the changes you see are due to the
fact that we use monte - carlo simulation method ,
which accuracy depends on the number of simulations . even if we don ' t change
the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers ,
we get slightly different result from the model .
so : to see the effect of using different correlations between gas and power
we should look at the aggregate number .
i calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves i got from paul . as the
weights along the term structure i used the product of price , position and
volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slots . the results
are shown below :
inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced
negatively definite correlation matrix , which brakes var engine .
correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non - negative by
definition , and remains non - negatively definite if calculated properly based
on any historical data .
here , according to our phone discussion , we started experimenting with
correlations , assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec
versus gas . i am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results . in
addition to the aggregate var numbers for the runs oliver did , you can see
the var numbers based on correlation matrix 1 and matrix 2 . in matrix 1 the
correlations across efa slots are identical to these in original matrix .
i obtained this matrix by trial and error . matrix 2 is produces by naveen
using finger ' s algorithm , it differs from original matrix across efa slots as
well
as in power versus gas correlations and gives higher var than matrix 1 does .
concluding : we will look at the historical forward prices and try to
calculate historical correlations from them .

0 . 1 ol 0 . 134 mm o 3 . 197 mm

0 . 3 ol 0 . 030 mm o 3 . 245 mm

0 . 5 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 6 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 7 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 8 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 9 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
1 . 0 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix ' s
integrity .
interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0 . 2 the power var
increases which is counter to intuition . this implies that we need to look
into how the correlations are being applied within the model . once we can
derive single correlations from the term structure , is the next action to
understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the p + l
volatility in the spread option deals .
from 0 . 4 onwards the var calculation failed .

subject : el paso had market power
in a release from natural gas intelligence according to ferc staff counsel , el paso natural gas and el paso merchant energy possessed market power during the summer of 2000 and violated ferc ' s marketing affiliate standards . the article states that el paso had market power after may 2000 for at least two months when pipeline capacity constraints created a separate relevant geographic market in california . the evidence pointed to the now - infamous february 7 and 9 , 2000 telephone conversations showing that the operating employees of el paso merchant , el paso natural gas and mojave pipeline "" were not functioning independently , "" according to staff counsel .
the phone conversations took place just days before el paso pipeline began its open season for 1 . 22 bcf / d of firm , capacity on its system ( bound for california ) , all awarded to el paso merchant .
before and during the open season , epme gained new information about the restructured long - term tiered discount on mojave to wheeler ridge while potential non - affiliate shippers were not according to counsel . as a result , counsel find that epme ' s group had an undue competitive advantage with the new mojave discount generating a successful bid for the el paso pipeline capacity .

"Subject: california assembly releases "" modified mou "" for edison
please forward to others who need this information .
as you know , enron ' s been involved with a group of business customers , small customers , labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core / noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to edison ' s mou with the governor .
today , the assembly leadership released a bill ( ab 82 xx ) that modifies the mou but does not follow the core / noncore proposal negotiated by the group . the bill just came out , is about 80 pages long , and thorough analysis has not yet been completed . the url for the bill is attached . based on a meeting attended this morning in sacramento , the key features of the bill ( which is attached ) are :
direct access suspended until 1 . 1 . 2003 ( suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill )
transmission sale at 2 x book .
approximately 90 % ( or greater ) of edison ' s undercollection absorbed by customers 20 kw and above .
create a trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar ( but does not do away with the suits , investigations , etc . )
the bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the dwr contracts and what the payment structure will look like .
reaction and timetable
very chaotic , with considerable uncertainty about where ( if anywhere ) the bill will go , leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility .
business customers ( and of course enron ) are strongly opposed
republicans are strongly opposed
labor has big problems with the tx sale unless they get assurances that tx labor jobs are guaranteed , which is not yet included in the bill
we are working with business to remove the direct access suspension
we are also working on the senate side to attempt to get the senate to include direct access in their version of the modified mou , but the senate has been more hostile than the assembly to direct access .
senate democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay general fund for power already purchased from the dwr contracts . ab 82 xx does not address this issue .
senate democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "" modified mou . "" word is that the senate will release their bond language and their "" modified "" mou this weekend or early next week .
the assembly will hold an "" informational "" hearing on the bill tomorrow ( saturday ) to get members up to speed
the assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on monday , with the intent of sending the bill to the full assembly for a vote on tuesday .
the legsilature is supposed to have a month - long recess beginning friday , july 20 th , which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then , or suspend the recess and continue working
will continue to provide updates as events unfold . if folks have additional comments on the bill , please direct them to harry kingerski and leslie lawner , who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in sacramento .
if there are any questions , my pager is 888 . 916 . 7184 .

subject : mhi 501 f disposition planning
with the shipment of two of the four units from mhi scheduled for august and no viable place to ship them , our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly . we need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position .
based on discussion with a number of people , i would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible . john garrison has identified a number of potential buyers , and i believe that brett wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak .
we should inform mhi that we will now target unit 3 for fort pierce , given the slowdown in the fort pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from mhi on unit 1 . if we also drop the dual fuel requirement for fort pierce , we should provide some project savings to that project . prior to informing mhi , we shoud have jackson chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs .
i also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for tallahassee , unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3 rd unit to a buyer . in the next three weeks we will review tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project .
finally , mhi has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from august 2 to the end of august . i think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly , given that we can ' t tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an august 2 ship date . we should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date .
probably everyone knows some of this , and some know all of this , but hopefully the overall picture is of value .
thanks !

"Subject: description of ubs deal
louise - -
i need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from enron to ubs . if any of the data is viewed by ferc as being jurisdictional assets , than enron would need to inform ferc of that transfer before the transfer . clearly , customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information . i need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data .
who can help me get a better handle on this on monday ?
also , i understand the "" adoption "" by ubs of enron contracts . initially i was under the impression that this was simply a "" review "" . again , any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by enron . i have seen one draft of the interim agreement , but assume that you would do this for eei and other physical contracts . am i right ?

just when you thought it was safe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
we need to start working on getting everyone together who is in netco in time for the sale of the company . the ideal move time would be either this week - end or the next . the idea is that everyone ( 856 ) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building . hr has the most up to date list of who all of the people are . but essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today .
all commercial people on 6 , non - commerical on 5 . we would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine ( but hold off on implementing that piece ) .
as the credit group is already here ( in the room next to mine ) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back .

good morning ,
here are the recent developments in the california power crisis :
- yesterday , governor davis gave a press conference to announce a qf agreement that would ensure future utility payments and possibly deter involuntary bankruptcy filings by certain qfs . a cpuc order on long - term qf contracts is expected next tuesday .
- corroborating the governor ' s announcement , edison international and pg & e corp each announced yesterday that it reached agreement with the qfs for payment of future deliveries .
- the governor laid out a schedule that targets a final resolution to the utilities ' final crisis by mid - april . on april 3 , the cpuc is expected to issue an order on dwr cost recovery . a final settlement for the utilities is anticipated 10 - 15 days afterwards .
- significantly , the governor expects that ( 1 ) the final settlement will occur within the existing rate structure , and ( 2 ) that the dwr will recover its costs with priority over the qfs and utilities .
- the achievement of a qf agreement may make potential bankruptcy appear more remote and therefore support the stocks in the near - term . however , we believe that substantially more effort will be required to resolve the utilities ' financial crisis . we recommend that investors avoid eix ( $ 12 . 04 , hold ) and pcg ( $ 11 . 40 , hold ) , unless they have a high tolerance for risk and volatility .
please call us with any questions you may have .

vnbl stock expected to explode ! ! !
vinoble is the next hot play in homeland security
symbol : vnbl . ob
current price : $ 0 . 08
short term target price : $ 0 . 5 o
12 month target price : $ 4 . 0 o
deserves your immediate attention ! ! !
the company just bottomed at $ o . o 6 and we believe in the next 1 to 2
weeks this stock will go back to at least $ o . 4 o
c o m p a n y o v e r v i e w
vinoble , inc . ( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland
security , security information systems , and other security services to
provide long term growth for its shareholders .
vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in
the security sector is unprecedented .
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 20 ol have
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both
physical
and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments ,
especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the
focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security
services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of
forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products
and
services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 .
vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security
market by delivering professional services , security products , security
training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective ,
vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals
offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will
help
organizations protect key assets including persons , property ,
information ,
brand , and reputation .
homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the
healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) ,
sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued
increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble
intends
to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients ,
alliance
partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are
the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious
provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of
each
client .
management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( "" gccc "" ) to assist
in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such
acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at
present ,
vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential
acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and
audits , the
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis
required for listing on a national exchange .
here is recent news on the company :
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb :
vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information
systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition
of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps
tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software ,
and patents .
following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification )
technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use
applications , the company has concluded that the need for application
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the
framework which operates such technology . the company has identified
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software ,
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element .
middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both
internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves
routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web
services and service - oriented architectures .
since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and
non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling
customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with
customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of
assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the
manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will
enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply
chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid
and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system .
the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology
will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing
rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of
businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and
assets in this current state of constant threat .

subject : ena research : argentina default and devaluation risk rises . brazil feels the effects of the contagion
date : 12 july 2001
from : maureen raymond - castaneda
gwyn koepke
we believe that the risk of an argentine debt default has increased and peso devaluation risk has also risen substantially in the last several days .
due to recent economic and fiscal developments in argentina , we believe :
argentina lacks the fiscal and monetary maneuverability to lift itself out of a 3 - year recession ( exacerbated by a global slowdown ) and a strong peso . argentina ' s fiscal position has weakened substantially due to economic weakness that limits government revenue receipts needed to balance the fiscal deficit and pay off the country ' s debt service . a loss of investor confidence has caused spreads to widen despite argentina ' s need to rollover about $ 8 bn of short - term letes ( argentine government debt ) by the end of the year . yields paid at this week ' s treasury auction are at levels that are not sustainable over the medium - term . three - month treasury yields are 14 . 01 % ( versus 9 . 1 % paid at auction on june 26 and 7 . 89 % on june 12 ) . in addition to suffering from widening yields , argentina was forced to shorten the tenor of debt from a mix of 6 - month and 1 - year bonds issued previously to only 3 - month securities at this week ' s auction due to increased risk aversion to longer - term government paper by local investors ( pension funds and banks ) . the sharp increase in letes yields , and the inability to issue longer maturities , is highly indicative of the difficulty the argentine government will have in rolling over $ 8 bn in short - term paper over the remainder of the year at sustainable rates , which further weakens its fiscal position due to higher interest payments .
the recession has been exacerbated by the strong peso caused by the persistently strong us dollar , which has hurt argentina ' s export competitiveness especially vis - a - vis the brazilian real that has depreciated about 25 % relative to the usd since the beginning of the year . as a result to these factors , we believe the risks of argentine debt default and peso devaluation are mounting .
argentina is increasingly vulnerable to a run on the banking system . argentines are switching from peso to dollar deposits . argentina ' s limited forex reserves constrain the central bank ' s ability to support the peso , if private sector deposits are withdrawn or converted into u . s . dollars . private sector deposits of $ 74 bn are 33 % peso - denominated , or $ 25 bn , and 67 % are foreign currency - denominated deposits , which dwarf argentina ' s official forex reserves of $ 25 bn . total private sector deposits fell about $ 5 bn ( from $ 77 . 5 bn to $ 72 . 4 bn ) between february and end - april this year before stabilizing at $ 74 bn as of july 6 th .
political uncertainty is very high and throws into serious doubt economic minister cavallo ' s ability to win opposition support for a new fiscal austerity program announced late yesterday . cavallo needs to win approval for his fiscal agenda not only at the national level , but also at the provincial level , which will not be easy considering the 3 - year contraction . failure to gain this support to cutback spending will worsen argentina ' s fiscal woes , and cause a further deterioration of investor confidence .
these external and internal pressures leave the exchange rate vulnerable to speculative attack and threaten the 1 - to - 1 dollar peg , especially in light of the country ' s limited foreign exchange reserves . today , argentina ' s 1 - month ndf traded at pl . 15 , implying risk of a 15 % devaluation , while yesterday , the 1 - month ndf traded at pl . 05 ( implying an increased probability of devaluation since yesterday ) . also today , the 1 - year ndf traded at 1 . 25 , implying a 25 % devaluation . as a result of these above internal and external pressures , we believe the risk of peso devaluation has increased substantially .
the danger of a steep devaluation is that private sector firms that hold dollar - denominated debt and are long pesos and short dollars will suffer from sharply higher debt payments . this could cripple an already tenuous economic situation by causing a further deterioration in government revenue through lower tax receipts .
developments in argentina impact brazil through 3 main channels :
currency volatility : contagion from argentina has lead to a substantially weaker brazilian real . triggered by a general sell off of argentine stocks , bonds and currency , the real has depreciated 24 % since the beginning of the year to close today at r 2 . 55 . to stem the real ' s recent decline , central bank president fraga hiked interest rates 150 bp and simultaneously intervened in the forex market june 22 , which stemmed the real ' s depreciation for about one week ( see gmm , 29 june ) . recent currency volatility could result in further central bank intervention by drawing on brazil ' s forex reserves . fraga has indicated the central bank will intervene to support the real ' s value . a weak real will also translate into higher inflation expectations in brazil .
emerging market credit spreads : argentina represents about 25 % of total emerging market debt traded . current investor concern about argentina has consequently widened emerging market debt spreads . wider spreads put upward pressure on overnight rates in brazil , reducing liquidity and increasing costs of debt service in brazil .
trade mechanism : further downward pressure on economic output in brazil ( already aggravated by the drought - induced energy crisis ) brought on by weaker export market growth to argentina . also , the weaker argentine peso would reduce brazil ' s export competitiveness within the mercosur trade bloc .
this week ' s gmm will contain more details on the contagion effects on brazil as well as argentina ' s disappointing treasury bill auction , the trend in private sector deposits , cavallo ' s new fiscal measures to cut spending , argentina ' s heightened political risk associated with the need for fiscal austerity amid concerns over provincial political support and s & p ' s debt downgrade to "" b - "" , which is one notch below moody ' s rating of "" b 2 "" .

hello - - listen , wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest
publication last week , the risk desk . because of the size of the files we
sent out , quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails
over a certain size . anyhow , if you didn ' t receive the issue , hit the reply
button and type "" resend risk desk . "" responce so far has been great for those
of you that received the free copy - - we think you ' ll agree that it ' s soon to
become the leading "" must read "" publication on market , credit , price and
operational risk management in the energy space .
also , just a reminder , the charter price for a one year subscription ( $ 199 )
ends soon . let us know .

"Subject: gmat review available at enron
gmat review at enron
the next gmat review course at enron will begin monday , november 26 th :
the schedule is :
course # 7019 - 00 : monday nights , nov 26 - jan 28 ( no class dec 24 or
dec 31 )
this course is identical to the courses that started in october . it is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
gmat before january 31 for the purposes of applying to business school .
course details :
- class is held at enron in room ecn 560 and is restricted to enron
employees
- each course is limited to eight students
- meets once a week for eight weeks
- hours are 6 : 00 - 9 : 00 pm ( first session will run til 10 : 00 pm to
include initial exam )
- expect 4 - 5 hours of homework per week
- course includes a total of four practice gmat exams
- ends the second week of december , allowing employees to take the
gmat in december and meet a january application deadline .
- special discount of $ 200 off the regular princeton review tuition
enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the enron building for
convenience of its employees . individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees . financial support from enron is at manager ' s discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance .
how to enroll :
1 . print out the attached registration form .
2 . complete the form , but please note the following
specific instructions :
a . fill out the student information completely , including
your email address .
b . in the enrollment section , where it says "" please enroll
me in gmat class size - 8 course # _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ "" ,
c . in the payment section : for the course at enron , the
tuition is discounted by $ 200 , to $ 899 .
full payment of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form . be sure to indicate complete cardholder

the princeton review office at the same $ 200 discount .
call ( 800 ) 2 review to register or to receive a list of course schedules .
importance of the gmat :
the gmat score is a critical part of your application to business
school . indeed , in many cases , it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants . while work
experience , gpa , essays , and interviews are all important components of
your application , the gmat is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time .
the texas mba tour :
all interested enron employees are invited to attend the texas mba
tour , which will be in houston on wednesday , january 23 . the texas mba
tour , of which the princeton review is a partner , is a group of six business
schools that host a joint mba panel discussion and admissions fair . the
participating schools are texas , rice , smu , baylor , tcu , and texas a & m .
the princeton review has agreed to handle registration for the event , so

mark mentioned you had called regarding enrononline comments . here is the currently approved enrononline statement :
for the past two years , enron has used 30 - day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on enrononline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day - to - day basis . due to the unusual events of the last few weeks , we provided some daily information . however , we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward . while we saw some decrease in volumes on enrononline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement , volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of more than 5 , 700 transactions with a notional value exceeding $ 2 . 7 billion .
does this meet with your approval ? in light of the merger , we are getting away from the daily regurgitation of numbers and back to our former policy .

as the deal clearly turned sour and lowest offer in the 70 ' s , i opted to take the short to the imbalance and hedge the price risk
he 15 bought 42 mw from aquilla at a fixed price of $ 55 and sold 42 mw vs the "" expost settlement price ""
he 16 bought 38 mw from aquilla at a fixed price of $ 55 and sold 38 mw vs the "" expost settlement price ""

enron looks for investors , but finds them skittish

enron ' s attempt to quietly line up a big - name investor to demonstrate its financial strength seems to have backfired .
overtures to several prominent investors have failed to turn up any takers , sending the stock to a new low yesterday . uncertainty about the impact of enron ' s troubles have also prompted one big energy trader to unwind some positions .
representatives of enron , the energy trading company based in houston , have approached warren e . buffett , the chairman of berkshire hathaway , but he decided not to pursue a major investment in the company , according to a person close to the talks . part of mr . buffett ' s reluctance was an unwillingness to sign a confidentiality agreement with the company that would preclude him from trading in enron ' s debt , the person said . officials of berkshire hathaway did not return phone calls tuesday .
more than a dozen buyout firms , including clayton , dubilier the blackstone group , and kohlberg kravis roberts , have expressed little interest , according to a person close to the talks . the g . e . capital unit of general electric has also been approached , this person said , and has not ruled out an investment . officials from all of the companies declined comment or did not return telephone calls . the overtures were reported tuesday by the wall street journal .
although it used its pipeline assets last week to secure a $ 1 billion credit line , the company ' s ability to obtain additional financing is unclear to investors . shares of enron fell $ 1 . 50 yesterday to $ 9 . 67 , the lowest since 1992 .
enron could lose its investment - grade credit rating . if it did , traders might shift their business elsewhere because of additional risk . a ratings cut could also trigger early redemption of debt that enron has guaranteed , forcing the company to issue tens of millions of new shares to cover the debt .
moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s rate enron two notches above ' ' junk ' ' status , while fitch investors service lowered it this week to just one notch above junk . fitch cited ' ' the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence ' ' and said that it would consider further downgrades .
the company ' s prospects are further clouded by an investigation into enron ' s finances by the securities and exchange commission . on tuesday , officials with the milken institute said jeffrey k . skilling , enron ' s former chief executive officer who resigned in august , had to cancel a seminar appearance because he had to go to washington . a spokesman for mr . skilling said he was not in washington today , but that he was planning to answer questions from the s . e . c .
according to a person close to the company , enron hopes within the next week to outline publicly the various off - balance - sheet debts and related - party transactions that have drawn the attention of the s . e . c .
officials with other large energy companies , including duke energy , dynegy inc . and reliant inc . , declined comment tuesday on whether they have had discussions about making an investment in enron .
a senior executive at the el paso corporation , the houston natural gas giant with a market capitalization that is now three times that of enron , said the company might be interested in acquiring assets from enron but was unlikely to do a large transaction . ' ' we like companies that have hard assets , ' ' said the executive , adding that no talks were under way about asset purchases , although the executive said el paso officials believe enron will survive this crisis .
large energy traders said tuesday that they are still doing business with enron , though they continue to watch the situation very closely . some executives also said some energy producers may be steering business away from enron and to other traders and marketers .
an enron spokesman said that transaction volume remains unchanged in the company ' s north american natural gas and power business - - which accounts for more than 90 percent of the company ' s trading .
officials at one of the largest independent natural gas producers , the apache corporation of houston , said they have unwound nearly all of their hedges on gas prices in the last few days over concerns about what would happen to the marketplace for energy derivatives if enron collapsed . apache , like many gas producers , had entered into financial contracts allowing it to sell natural gas at set prices . with the steep drop in prices this year , apache has large paper gains on those contracts .
apache has been able to unwind all but one hedge , a complicated transaction that involves enron and other parties , said ray plank , apache ' s chairman . the primary reason for unwinding the hedges , he said , ' ' is that the market is having to digest the major impact of enron ' s credit problems . ' '
apache has about a gain of about $ 70 million from the various transactions , he said . ' ' we ' ve got a stack of chips in front of us , and we decided we ' d take them and get out of the game . ' '

companies & finance the americas - companies scale back enron business

energy houston company feels commercial impact of continuing public relations crisis .
counterparties are starting to withdraw their business from enron , in an early sign that the embattled company ' s trading business could be adversely affected by the company ' s continuing public relations crisis .
aquila said it had been reducing its exposure to enron for some time because of its risk limits . the company ' s risk - management controls have obliged it to scale down exposure to enron as dealing with the houston - based energy trader has come to be considered more of a risk .
separately , apache , an oil company , said it was closing out of some of the hedges it had put on with enron .
raymond plank , apache chairman and chief executive , said his company was now pulling back from all hedging , including those with enron . "" if they have 25 per cent of the market , and they continue to have the problems which are evident daily , they could start a tidal wave , which could affect other elements of the futures market , "" he said .
mr plank added that apache was also to stop selling enron crude oil , the only other business it did with the energy company . "" we don ' t want the credit risk , "" he said .
an enron spokesman said aquila remained one of enron ' s most prominent counterparties , though he added that he could not comment about whether aquila might have reduced its credit exposure to enron . apache is a small customer in what , for enron , is a small business , he added .
enron has been under pressure since october 16 , when management announced that the company had incurred a $ 1 . 01 bn charge and $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholders ' equity as a result of some off - balance sheet dealings . the company has also become the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation as a result of those dealings .
since that announcement the company ' s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent and enron ' s long - term debt has been downgraded by all three leading credit rating agencies .
but despite the pr crisis , enron has repeatedly stressed that its core trading business has been performing well .
enron counterparties ' growing wariness comes at a time of continuing nervousness over the company ' s balance sheet . one of the company ' s first actions after the initial announcement was to draw down $ 3 . 3 bn of bank lines to protect itself against fickle commercial - paper lenders spurning it . then , earlier this week , enron followed that up by raising $ 1 bn from a secured credit line co - arranged by jp morgan chase and citigroup .
at the time of the new bank deal , an official close to the bank group described the funds as "" comfort "" funds which the company could simply "" stack up in the lobby "" , in order to reassure investors .
unfortunately , the loan does not seem to have reassured investors as much as was hoped . enron is now talking to private equity firms , including the blackstone group , about supporting it with a $ 2 bn investment .
off - balance sheet entities affiliated to enron owe $ 8 bn - $ 9 bn in debt . enron itself is carrying $ 12 . 8 bn in debt .

enron ' s weaknesses threaten industry

executives in the energy industry voiced concern tuesday at the continuing decline in the value and credit rating of enron corp . and questioned how long chief executive kenneth lay will keep his job .
enron ' s stock slumped to its lowest point in 91 / 2 years on reports that the houston - based energy giant is stumping for a cash infusion of $ 2 billion or more .
the fear among executives across many energy sectors is that enron ' s ability to maintain markets in contracts for electricity and natural gas would collapse under the weight of its falling credit standing and the growing reluctance of other energy companies to do business with it .
enron is the world ' s largest trader of energy contracts , taking in more than $ 140 billion in revenue in the first nine months of this year from buying and selling electric power and natural gas contracts worth more than $ 500 billion in aggregate .
industry sources estimate that enron is involved in one - third of all energy contracts . if such a market maker could not function because of lack of financing , the ripple effects could be a disaster for energy industries , experts said .
"" what we ' re seeing is a threat to far more than a single company or even a single industry , "" one energy investor said .
leading energy executives have been approached by institutional investors to consider forming a new management team , sources said tuesday . such a team would step in at enron to work out its difficulties , which stem from transactions and obligations the company evidently made with at least 33 off - balance - sheet partnerships from which enron managers profited .
lawyers suing the company say enron used the affiliated partnerships to hide liabilities from shareholders . investors also have accused company executives of conflicts of interest because they acted on investments for both the company and the partnerships .
the thinking in energy circles in houston and elsewhere , sources said , is that enron chairman and ceo lay would have to resign to allow the company to attract fresh financing . enron was reported tuesday in the wall street journal to be seeking $ 2 billion in financing .
sources in houston reported that the company was discussing emergency financing with blackstone group , a new york - based investment firm . widespread reports had major oil companies , particularly royal dutch / shell group , considering a buyout of enron .
jeffrey skilling , who resigned suddenly in august as enron ' s ceo , was reported to be under subpoena to testify in washington . enron is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for possibly failing to properly disclose off - balance - sheet partnerships to shareholders .
meanwhile , the company ' s stock declined $ 1 . 50 a share to $ 9 . 67 on the new york stock exchange , the stock ' s lowest closing price since 1992 . less than a year ago , enron stock sold for $ 84 . 88 a share .
enron ' s credit rating has been downgraded by fitch inc . , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , with fitch on monday taking the company ' s credit to bbb - , one level above noninvestment grade .
fitch analyst ralph pellecchia said his agency would drop enron to junk status if the company made no progress in reducing its debt , if its trading business were to show signs of significant deterioration or if expenses and charges from noncore businesses it is selling should exceed current estimates .
a rating below investment grade would present further obstacles to enron ' s ability to continue making markets in electricity and natural gas supplies . a fall below investment grade also would trigger early repayment of $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds that otherwise would not be due until 2002 and 2003 .
"" there are a lot of things they can do that people might perceive as being positive , "" pellecchia said . "" they are trying to show that they have the cash available and the capacity of managing their businesses over time , of getting out of bad businesses and running their business more openly and transparently . obviously , this is a process . ""
enron ' s troubles have cascaded of late . the company reported a $ 618 - million loss in the third quarter and a $ 1 . 2 - billon reduction in shareholder equity - - after two years in which its annual revenue more than trebled .
the company led a trend in energy trading , creating an internet - based network , enrononline , that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity , natural gas , oil and coal to trade with one another . enron made markets in all those commodities , putting up its own capital to buy and sell them .
it is that key role as a clearinghouse that has put enron in greatest peril because it needs a continuing flow of cash to act as "" the buyer for every seller and the seller to every buyer , "" said philip k . verleger jr . , a newport beach energy economist .
"" enron is now trying to reach out to other people to get them to fund this enrononline . . . but a lot of companies have been moving business out of enron , "" he said .
ironically , california is in the position to help push enron deeper into trouble , verleger said .
that is because enron is owed millions of dollars by california for electricity sold to the state and its utilities during the power crisis , and enron , in its role as market maker , probably has a hand in many of the controversial long - term power contracts signed this year by the state . gov . gray davis , other politicians and state regulators have repeatedly accused enron of overcharging for electricity .
"" if gray davis were to pull the plug on the state ' s electricity deals with enron or other firms , he quite possibly could put enron into bankruptcy , "" verleger said . "" how quickly things change . ""
if enron were to collapse , he said , much of the company ' s trading business could simply migrate to smaller competitors , as happened when junk - bond powerhouse drexel burnham lambert inc . folded in 1990 . but such a collapse could seriously damage the trading of electricity , he said , because enron pioneered that market and its complex financial instruments .

fund track
mutual - fund manager exits merrill lynch

new york - - james d . mccall , a star mutual - fund manager when he was hired two years ago by merrill lynch & co . but whose investment performance took a breathtaking fall as tech stocks crumbled , left the company .
the two merrill funds run by mr . mccall , who specializes in aggressive , fast - trading stock picking , are among the worst - performing stock funds of any kind over the last year , costing investors hundreds of millions of dollars since his big bets on technology turned sour during the past year .
the $ 329 million merrill lynch focus twenty fund lost shareholders 81 % of their investment during the past 12 months . mr . mccall ' s other portfolio , the $ 66 million premier growth fund , is down 68 % . when the two portfolios were rolled out during the spring of 2000 , investors entrusted $ 1 . 2 billion to the funds .
a merrill spokesman said mr . mccall , 48 years old , wasn ' t available to comment and that the firm wouldn ' t comment on the reason for his departure .
mr . mccall ' s resignation is the first high - profile departure from the merrill lynch investment managers since jeffrey peek , the group ' s president , resigned in late september after being passed over for the post of president at the brokerage firm . that post instead went to e . stanley o ' neal .
mr . peek recruited mr . mccall slightly more than two years ago from pilgrim baxter & associates , a wayne , pa . , money manager , with the aim of broadening merrill ' s then - struggling fund lineup away from its focus on the bargain - oriented value stocks , which at the time were out of favor . mr . mccall ' s specialty is aggressively trading the stocks of fast - growing companies in a style known as momentum investing . his portfolios often were concentrated among small numbers of stocks , adding to their volatile nature .
while at pilgrim baxter , mr . mccall ' s funds were among the top - performing portfolios of their kind . in 1998 , for example , the pbhg large cap 20 fund gained 68 % in a year when the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 28 . 5 % .
however , even before mr . mccall joined merrill , there was controversy . mr . peek ' s efforts to lure him away from pilgrim baxter turned into a legal battle between merrill and pilgrim baxter , which eventually was settled under terms that weren ' t publicly disclosed . but what proved to be a bigger problem was that at just about the moment that merrill launched mr . mccall ' s funds to great fanfare , his style of investing went cold .
"" talk about an ill - fated venture , "" says russel kinnel , director of fund analysis at morningstar inc . "" they couldn ' t have timed it worse . ""
even compared with other growth funds , mr . mccall ' s funds posted exceptionally large losses . while the focus twenty fund has lost 72 % since the start of the year , the average large - cap growth fund is down 27 . 5 % , according to morningstar .
mr . mccall ' s portfolios were heavily invested in technology , telecommunications and biotechnology stocks . mr . mccall also had a big wager on enron corp . , the energy company whose stock has plunged 88 % during the year . according to the most recent information available , enron was the ninth - largest position in the focus twenty fund .
"" his numbers are shockingly bad even by the standard of other growth momentum funds , "" mr . kinnel says . "" if you look at what is in the funds . . . if it went down , he owned it . ""
taking mr . mccall ' s place on both funds will be another pbhg veteran , michael hahn . mr . hahn currently manages merrill ' s $ 11 million mid cap growth fund , which also has had a rough year , losing 57 % . the merrill spokesman said mr . mccall "" is making himself available to assist in the transition "" of the funds management to mr . hahn .
morningstar ' s mr . kinnel said despite the fund ' s poor performance , "" the fact that they are putting mike hahn on the funds indicates that merrill isn ' t throwing in the towel on the momentum strategy . ""
by late yesterday , mr . mccall ' s name and photograph had been replaced by mr . hahn ' s on the merrill web site .

jeff skilling , the former chief executive officer of enron corp . , has been contacted by the securities and exchange commission .
the sec is investigating business dealings between enron and investment partnerships run by the company ' s recently removed chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
skilling plans to answer questions from the sec , denis calabrese , a spokesman for skilling , said tuesday .
wall street has raised a number of questions about enron ' s financial reporting and stability since the company released third - quarter earnings oct . 16 .
in the earnings report , enron disclosed it had taken a $ 35 million loss related to ending its relationships with investment partnerships formerly run by fastow , who was then chief financial officer . it also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
fastow resigned his role with the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , in june after criticism from some on wall street . enron replaced him oct . 24 . skilling unexpectedly resigned in august as ceo , citing personal reasons .
enron has previously said its auditors and attorneys reviewed the fastow - ljm arrangements and that its board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements .
however , a special board committee is now reviewing transactions involving ljm and possibly other entities .
shares in enron fell $ 1 . 50 tuesday to $ 9 . 67 .

us stocks trimmed their their losses , immediately following the federal reserve ' s decision to lower short - term interest rates by 50 basis points yesterday .
wall street had widely expected the central bank to cut rates for the 10 th time this year to help stimulate the us economy . but the decision by the fed policymakers to cut by more aggressive 50 bp lowering the federal funds rate to 2 per cent following a recent rash of grim economic data bolstered the market . in late trading , the dow jones industrial average was off 9 . 82 at 9 , 431 . 21 and the s & p 500 index 2 . 25 at 1 , 100 . 59 . the nasdaq composite gained 1 . 41 at 1 , 795 . 06 .

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones in the 1990 s , the u . s . held that distinction . in both cases , the good times ended with the bursting of a stock - market bubble , pricked , at least in part , by a nervous central bank . in both cases , predictions of a quick turnaround proved to be wrong .
the excessive american investment in fiber - optic high - speed phone lines echoes japan ' s decade - earlier investment binge in memory - chip factories . the plight of one well - respected american company , enron corp . - - which has lost two - thirds of its market value in just three weeks - - is reminiscent of the previously invisible weakness japan ' s slump exposed at many of that country ' s banks . even the recent squabbling in the u . s . congress that threatens to derail a package of economic - stimulus measures sounds eerily similar to the bureaucratic and political wrangling that stymied bold fixes in japan .
and now , u . s . monetary policy , considered to be the most powerful tool for countering the nation ' s downturns , is looking increasingly like japan ' s , as interest rates fall toward zero .
japan has endured a decade of stagnation . could that happen here ?
most analysts continue to answer with a resounding no . they point out that japan burst not just a stock - market bubble , but also a real - estate bubble , which in turn laid low its banking system . the u . s . bubble appears to have been limited to stocks , and the american banking system remains strong .
u . s . policy makers also insist that they are wiser than their japanese counterparts , in part because they have learned from japan ' s mistakes . and , they add , the u . s . economic and political system is more flexible than japan ' s and better able to make the necessary repairs .
"" it ' s easy to raise the suspicion that the japanese and american economies have some similarities , "" u . s . treasury secretary paul o ' neill said in a recent interview . "" i don ' t think it ' s apt to make a comparison . "" among other things , he says : "" they ' re not an open economy . one of the things that has really been beneficial to our economy is this openness and the challenge that we have permitted to come in here , from foreign suppliers from all over the world . . . . ""
moreover , the u . s . central bank hasn ' t yet exhausted its rate - cutting options . in announcing its half - point rate cut yesterday , the fed ' s policy committee made clear that it remained poised to keep cutting rates down into the 1 % range if deemed necessary . "" for the foreseeable future , "" it declared , "" the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness . ""
u . s . markets have rallied in recent weeks on the assumption that the fed still will be able to turn things around by next year . indeed , after trading a bit lower yesterday in the hours before the fed ' s 2 : 15 p . m . est rate announcement , the dow jones industrial average soared 150 . 09 points , or 1 . 59 % , to finish at 9591 . 12 , just 14 points below its close the day before the sept . 11 terrorist attacks on the u . s .
fed chairman alan greenspan continues to cling to his faith in the u . s . economy ' s future . "" the long - term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate , "" the fed said in its statement yesterday .
yet the japanese were no less confident about their economy a decade ago , even as it slipped into prolonged crisis . "" our foundations are solid , "" declared bank of japan governor yasushi mieno , as he started cutting interest rates in 1991 .
japan ' s nikkei stock average peaked near 40000 in december 1989 . but in 1991 , when three leading economic institutes issued long - term forecasts for japan through the next decade and beyond , each saw long - term economic growth continuing at between 3 % and 5 % a year . instead , the country grew at an annual average of 1 . 1 % between 1992 and 2000 .
in april 1992 , as the nikkei appeared to be hitting bottom at 17000 , a consensus of a dozen top forecasters still foresaw japanese economic growth for the following year at between 2 % and 3 % . it ended up growing 0 . 4 % . today , the nikkei hovers around 10000 , and the japanese economy is back in its fourth recession of the past decade .
one reason for the unexpected length and depth of japan ' s decline is that its 1980 s bubble created a myriad of destructive excesses , many of which became evident only after the bubble popped . for example , it wasn ' t until 1991 that real - estate prices started falling - - and many analysts thought that decline would be temporary . it wasn ' t until the mid - 1990 s that economists saw how severely the fall in real - estate prices had hurt japan ' s big banks .
those bad investments continue to haunt japanese banks . the banks didn ' t lend so much directly to real - estate speculators ; instead , much of the money went through intermediaries such as non - bank finance companies and construction companies . today , many of those contractors are near insolvency , and the banks may have to take huge write - offs . "" we recognized that it would take a long time to be fixed , but even so , we thought that would mean two or three years , "" yoshimasa nishimura , a former head of the japanese finance ministry ' s banking bureau , says of the bubble .
and it took manufacturers many years to recognize that the capacity they had built up during the bubble was never going to be used . auto makers manufactured 13 . 5 million vehicles , including trucks and buses , in japan in 1990 . the number fell off gradually after that and now stands at about 10 million per year . for years , companies kept excess capacity and workers , betting that the falloff was temporary .
when japan ' s economy first slowed , there was widespread confidence that its government could easily manage the downturn . in the 1980 s , the country ' s fabled bureaucrats had a sterling reputation for economic management , much as mr . greenspan did in the u . s . during the 1990 s . with short - term interest rates at 6 % and a budget surplus of 8 . 8 trillion yen ( $ 72 . 3 billion ) - - or 2 % of gross domestic product - - the japanese central bank and parliament had plenty of room to cut rates , cut taxes , and boost public spending .
the bank of japan did ultimately cut rates by almost all six percentage points . politicians used the full surplus and even let the government run a primary budget deficit - - or deficit excluding bond issuance and repayment - - of 11 trillion yen , or 2 % of gdp . but they acted too slowly and in the end failed to jump - start the economy .
american policy makers give themselves higher marks for speed of response . the fed has cut interest rates by 4 . 5 percentage points in just 10 months . it took the bank of japan more than 4 1 / 2 years to do the same .
moreover , the u . s . congress has turned unprecedented budget surpluses into almost certain deficits with equal dispatch , passing a massive $ 1 trillion , 10 - year tax cut earlier this year and rapidly approving $ 40 billion in stimulus measures and a $ 15 billion airline bailout in the wake of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . members of congress now are caught up in a stalemate over a plan for $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion in additional stimulus actions , but that , too , has a good chance of enactment before year ' s end . the japanese diet , on the other hand , dallied for a year and a half before passing its first stimulus package .
even more important than the speed of america ' s policy makers , though , may be the flexibility of the american economy itself . analysts say the u . s . economy has a more self - cleansing form of capitalism that discourages the many excesses that built up in japan during the 1980 s .
a decade ago , the japanese boasted of having found the secret formula for smoothing out free - market business cycles . companies had friendly shareholders as well as bankers who provided "" patient capital "" that allowed for long - term technological investments in spite of weak quarterly earnings . lifetime employment guarantees gave workers a sense of income security , encouraging them to keep spending during downturns .
in retrospect , those same traits seem like weaknesses - - factors that shielded japanese companies from the free - market pressures that would have made them more efficient . the u . s . system , by contrast , is considered better equipped to shift resources from unproductive to productive uses .
even today , after the decade - long slump , the japanese company matsushita electric industrial co . refuses to lay off any of its 130 , 000 employees in japan , despite losses that are expected to exceed $ 2 billion this year . that ' s a far cry from u . s . companies , such as international business machines corp . and at & t corp . , which laid off workers even during the boom years , freeing up technology talent to go to newer , fast - growing rivals such as dell computer corp . or cisco systems inc .
in part , it is u . s . policy makers ' willingness to inflict short - term pain that allows for that flexibility . american officials argue that japan would have come out of its crisis more quickly if it had handled its banking crisis the way the u . s . handled the american savings and loan crisis in the 1980 s . back then , u . s . government - ordered thrift shutdowns and foreclosures caused shareholders to lose their investments and borrowers to lose their properties . in japan , failed banks were propped up , and their problems allowed to fester .
still , american - style free markets are hardly immune from excesses , and more and more become apparent the longer the economy idles . telecom companies spent tens of billions of dollars to lay tens of millions of miles of fiber - optic cables , an estimated 2 . 6 % of which is now being used .
blue - chip american express co . ended up writing off more than $ 1 billion in junk bond investments that were considered relatively low risks until the economy went sour . "" subprime "" lender providian financial corp . sent its earnings and stock price soaring in the late 1990 s by tapping the once largely ignored pool of consumers with checkered borrowing records . providian insisted that it used sophisticated models to limit its risks . nonetheless , it ended up announcing a surprising 71 % drop in third - quarter earnings last month , and its stock fell by more than half .
more surprises are almost certainly in store . many analysts argue that the u . s . stock market - - even at more than 25 % below its peak - - remains a bubble waiting to deflate further . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index still is trading at a price - to - earnings ratio of between 21 and 28 times earnings , depending on the measurement , and would need to fall at least 30 % to reach its historic average p / e ratio of 15 , according to the leuthold group , a minneapolis - based investment research firm .
to some analysts , the large amount of consumer debt outstanding in the u . s . is the ticking time bomb that could rival the bad loans dragging down japanese banks . american households borrowed freely and dipped deeply into savings during the 1990 s . in good times , with wages and stock portfolios rising , the situation seemed manageable . but now , as income - growth slows and mutual funds shrink , the burden could spin out of control . the fed estimates that the household debt - service burden - - the ratio of debt payments to after - tax income - - rose above 14 % earlier this year for the first time since 1987 . at about the same time , the number of americans filing for personal bankruptcy hit a record 390 , 064 .
one reason for the surge in american borrowing has been a sharp increase in the number of new home mortgages and a wave of mortgage refinancing to take advantage of falling interest rates and rising home values . both home sales and consumer spending , backed by rising housing values , have been rare bright spots over the past year in an otherwise dismal economy .
but there are dangers as well . one concern : that the sharp rise in home prices over the past four years - - nearly 20 % nationally , when adjusted for inflation , and more than 60 % in hot markets such as silicon valley , according to the office of federal housing enterprise oversight in washington - - could turn into a miniature version of japan ' s real - estate bubble .
another worry : that america ' s housing market isn ' t driven entirely by free - market forces . rather , this theory goes , it is propped up by japan - like government subsidies and easy loan terms made possible by widespread assumptions that the government would pick up the tab for any defaults .
the nation ' s mortgage market is dominated by fannie mae and freddie mac , government - chartered companies that are shareholder - owned but still enjoy various implicit and explicit subsidies , such as tax breaks and an emergency line of credit from the u . s . treasury . the two washington - area companies don ' t actually issue mortgages themselves . instead , they buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them into tradable securities . in doing so , they play a major role in influencing the size and shape of the market by setting underwriting standards for the loans they purchase .
some conservatives - - including the fed ' s mr . greenspan - - have expressed concern that fannie and freddie , by using government subsidies to expand the housing market , create distortions , drawing capital away from more productive uses . the congressional budget office estimates that the two companies last year enjoyed subsidies totaling $ 10 . 6 billion - - a number they say is exaggerated . other critics say that the companies encourage more , and riskier , lending than a completely free market would allow - - a pattern that may sustain housing demand in the near term but raises the risk of a bigger bust down the road . japan ' s woes have been exacerbated by formal and informal government backing for lenders . that includes a government housing loan corp . that gets a $ 3 billion annual subsidy and a separate state - run loan guarantee program that keeps many technically bankrupt small businesses afloat .
fannie mae chairman frank raines rejects the notion of any similarity between his company and japanese - style subsidies . "" their mortgage corporation has no private - market discipline - - there is no private management , no private equity capital , no private debt capital . "" fannie , he says , has all three , as well as tight regulatory standards requiring the company to keep enough capital on hand to withstand a catastrophe . the company ' s private shareholders , he adds , have every incentive to prevent overly risky lending , since they would lose their investments even if the government were to intervene to back the loans .
elsewhere on the business front , the vaunted flexibility of the american economy - - while perhaps raising efficiency in the long run - - could also serve to intensify a downturn . american corporations ' readiness to resort to layoffs at the first sign of weakness risks battering consumer confidence . in the past three months alone , the unemployment rate has soared by nearly a full percentage point - - to 5 . 4 % in october from 4 . 5 % in august , and the u . s . jobless rate once again exceeds japan ' s , which after a decade of stagnation still is 5 . 3 % .
even workers supposedly protected by union contracts have a fragile safety net . in the wake of the terrorist attacks , major airlines , such as amr corp ' s american airlines and delta air lines invoked force majeure clauses in their labor contracts , allowing them to skirt many negotiated protections and dump workers without advance notice . partly as a result , the conference board ' s index of consumer confidence plunged to 85 . 5 in october from 114 in august , one of the swiftest declines on record .
while japan ' s unique circumstances may account for some of its problems , they also may demonstrate a broader and more disturbing point : that policy may at times be relatively powerless to contain the destructive forces of a bursting bubble .
as companies are saddled with excess capacity , they have little incentive to borrow to expand , no matter how low interest rates fall . even after the sharp drop in capital spending over the past year , the percentage of industrial capacity in use in the u . s . in september was just 75 . 5 % - - the lowest level since 1983 and hardly an inducement for companies to build new factories .
layoff - spooked consumers also may be unwilling to spend tax rebates enacted to encourage shopping . a recent university of michigan survey concluded that just over one in five households have spent the rebate checks mailed out this summer , with the rest tucking the money into savings or using it to pay debt .
at the extreme , the supply overhang from a collapsing bubble can touch off a dangerous cycle of deflation , or falling prices . in a deflationary environment , consumers curb spending , waiting for goods to become still cheaper in the future . borrowers get crushed by debt burdens as their loans become more expensive in relative terms . companies , forced to keep cutting prices , cut back on workers and purchases of supplies , spreading pain throughout the economy .
in japan , deflation got under way in earnest in 1998 after the collapse of a major bank and securities company . in both 1998 and 1999 wholesale prices fell 1 . 5 % , and after a flat year in 2000 , they are falling again in 2001 . the u . s . isn ' t there yet . but commodity prices have fallen sharply since 1998 , while u . s . consumer prices , by some measures , appear to be slipping . the commerce department reported last week that its favored measure of inflation - - the price index for gross domestic purchases , or prices paid by u . s . residents - - fell by 0 . 3 % in the third quarter , a sharp reversal from the 1 . 3 % increase in the second quarter and the first quarterly decline in nearly 40 years . ( analysts say the number was artificially depressed by one - time factors relating to sept . 11 - - insurance benefit payouts that , for measurement purposes , lower insurance prices . )
in a deflationary world , the central bank ' s powers to respond are diminished because monetary policy works most effectively if interest rates can fall below the rate of inflation . but rates can ' t do that if inflation falls below zero .

finding someone who worries about america ' s oil supplies today is as hard as finding osama bin laden . we keep pumping gasoline into our suvs as if oil and war , like oil and water , never mix . yet we ' re fighting in a part of the world where a misstep or assassination could shock the oil market and suddenly jack prices up . i don ' t even want to think about how much economic damage that could do .
so far , investors have barely batted an eye . average prices for energy stocks plunged earlier this year - - forecasting less demand as business slowed . now , however , there ' s hope for a recovery by mid - 2002 . starting in late september , average prices turned and rose .
consumers , too , have put away their worry beads . just last may , drivers screamed when gasoline reached an average of $ 1 . 72 a gallon at the pump . now it ' s $ 1 . 25 and could drop by an additional
10 cents , says fred rozell , retail - pricing director at the oil price information service in lakewood , n . j .
you see the same story in natural gas . prices to residential consumers dropped about 23 percent over the first nine months of 2001 , according to the bureau of labor statistics . since october 2000 , the cost of home - heating oil has gone down 17 percent .
i don ' t mean to imply that the oil markets brushed bin laden off . crude prices spiked in london right after the terror attacks . businesses dependent on oil built higher inventories . but the hijacked planes crashed into a world economy that was already weak . oil demand slumped . opec prices plunged by almost one third , to less than $ 19 a barrel .
together , the opec countries pump 40 percent of the world ' s oil . last week they let it be known that they would cut production - - hoping to push up the price to $ 22 a barrel or higher . ( oil producers still have bad dreams about 1998 , when prices fell to $ 10 and their economies slipped . )
whether higher prices can be enforced , however , remains to be seen . non - opec countries , such as mexico and russia , might pump more oil to fill the gap . or the global recession might turn out to be worse than business now expects .
this war ' s economic risks seem to me to be extraordinarily high . take saudi arabia alone . the entire world needs saudi oil . that ' s the only country able to mobilize huge amounts of extra capacity , quickly , in case - - say - - iraq cuts off supplies and oil prices spike .
looking just at america , imports account for about half the oil we consume . two thirds of that goes for transportation - - cars , trucks , buses , trains , planes . forget suvs ; we ' re talking about basic business infrastructure . it doesn ' t run on green energy .
our devil ' s deal with the saudis is : you pump oil , we defend your corrupt regime against threats ( and zip our mouths , even when you let your schools and mosques preach jihad against americans in the middle east ) .
we keep some 5 , 000 u . s . military people on saudi soil . what we don ' t know is how far their power can actually reach . bin laden is making their presence a tinderbox issue for the radicals . just four weeks ago two people ( one american ) died in a bombing in the al khobar neighborhood , where 19 u . s . airmen were bombed in 1996 .
francis perrin , editorial manager of the paris - based journal arab oil & gas , thinks the saudi ruling family can hang on for a few more years , at least . if not , even hostile regimes pump oil - - witness iran .
any oil produced , anywhere , goes into the general global pool , says michael toman , a senior fellow at resources for the future in washington , d . c . one angry producer can ' t stop shipments just to the united states .
but one angry , big producer willing to pump less oil could hurt all users equally . and a new saudi regime could pump less , if it has fewer princes to support . prices might have to top $ 35 a barrel before americans start to conserve , says charlie ober , head of t . rowe price ' s new era fund .
so much for my fears . the stock market doesn ' t seem to share them . "" energy stocks start to perform when the economy reaches bottom , "" says j . c . waller , a portfolio manager for the icon energy fund . the gains since september suggest that investors see better business six to nine months out . a stronger economy by late 2002 would raise oil demand , raise prices and encourage drilling . that ' s why drilling and drilling - equipment stocks have been so strong .
as usual , buyers of individual stocks are walking into a minefield . ok - - the oil - drilling group has been one of the top 10 performers over the past three months . but among them , you got everything from nabors industries ( up 63 percent since late september ) to parker drilling ( down 55 percent since may ) .
and take enron , the hottie energy trader that soared to $ 89 last year . the securities and exchange commission is digging into its accounting . in just three weeks it slid 69 percent , to as low as $ 11 . 30 .
energy investors tend to rotate from sector to sector , making it tough for amateurs to keep up . that ' s where mutual funds come in .
but each "" energy "" fund takes a different tack . icon , for example , built its own computer model to root out what it hopes are undervalued stocks . ( its mathematics , however , don ' t include political risk . )
fidelity select energy service buys large drillers and servicers . that made it one of the worst funds this year because those stocks took such a beating during the first nine months , says dan mcneela at morningstar . as drillers gain , fidelity will turn around .
for more diversification , look at vanguard ' s energy fund . it invests in all sectors of oil and gas , so it ' s much less volatile than its competitors . "" we don ' t think people should have an energy port - folio all the time , "" says manager ernst von metzsch . but given the price drops in 2001 , he calls this the right time .
still , you have to ask , "" what if ? "" low stock prices ( and energy prices ) look interesting . but invest gradually over several months . recovery could be slow . it ' s not clear how risky this war will be .

enron cancels meeting with dabhol power lenders on court action

enron cancels meeting with dabhol power lenders on court action
mumbai , nov . 7 ( bloomberg ) - - dabhol power co . , enron corp . ' s
indian unit , said it canceled a two - day meeting with indian
lenders after local banks filed a suit to stop it from canceling
its power contract with maharashtra state .
officials from dabhol power , industrial development bank of
india and other local banks that helped fund the $ 3 billion power
project were scheduled to meet in singapore tomorrow to resolve
the ten - month - old payments dispute .
indian lenders yesterday filed a suit in the high court of
mumbai to stop dabhol power from canceling its power contract with
maharashtra state electricity board . a six - month notice period for
dabhol to cancel the contract with the board expires nov . 19 .
enron issued the notice on may 19 to end the contract because of
unpaid bills .
` ` the precipitous action taken by ifi ' s ( indian lenders ) , and
in which no advance notice was given to any parties including
foreign lenders , has resulted in cancellation of the scheduled
discussions ' ' on nov . 8 and 9 , dabhol said in a statement .
dabhol said it was ` ` surprised ' ' local banks filed a suit
just ahead of the singapore meeting ` ` specifically requested ' ' by
the lenders . government officials are meeting with enron in
washington later this week during indian prime minister atal
behari vajpayee ' s visit to the u . s .
indian lenders have lent dabhol $ 1 . 4 billion for the power
project and are most at risk if enron pulls out . they ' re concerned
the electricity board will be forced to buy the power plant if
enron carries out its threat , making it difficult for local
lenders to get back their loans .
enron owns 65 percent of dabhol , india ' s biggest foreign
investment . the board owes it $ 64 million for bills that are ten
months overdue . the board stopped buying power from dabhol in may ,
saying it was too expensive .
the court action by lenders ` ` is a precipitous step clearly
designed to frustrate ( dabhol ) and its stakeholders ' ability to
pursue legal remedies under the power purchase agreement , ' ' the
economic times quoted from a statement issued by dabhol .

( adds cancellation of singapore meeting and company ' s reaction in paras 3 - 7 )
bombay , nov 7 ( reuters ) - indian lenders to enron corp ' s dabhol power co ( dpc ) have filed a legal petition to try to prevent dpc from pulling out of the beleaguered power project , a senior banker said on wednesday .
"" we have moved the bombay high court to get an interim stay on a final termination notice and to stop dabhol from transferring its assets , "" the banker , who declined to be identified , told reuters .
the move provoked an angry reaction from dabhol .
the company immediately cancelled a scheduled meeting with domestic lenders in singapore on november 8 and 9 to discuss the issue .
"" dpc is disappointed with the legal action taken by the indian lenders , which is an attempt to deny dpc ' s foreign sponsors and lenders of their previously agreed to legal claims , "" it said in a statement .
the cancellation of the meeting is also a blow to efforts to solve the dispute , which has damaged india ' s efforts to attract more foreign investment in the power sector .
enron officials and the lenders were to discuss , among other things , proposals from two domestic companies , tata power and bses ltd , to buy out the u . s . company ' s stake in the project .
a final termination notice would cancel a power purchase agreement with the power plant ' s exclusive customer - maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) - and transfer ownership of the power plant to mseb .
dpc has not yet issued a final termination notice but it has taken a step towards that by issuing a notice of transfer of assets to mseb , which allows for the assets of the power plant to be valued .
both notices are provided for under mseb ' s power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with dabhol .
dpc and the authority have been feuding for a year over unpaid bills and tariffs . the 2 , 184 - megawatt power plant was shut down in june because of the dispute .
indian banks and other institutions have provided loans and guarantees of around $ 1 . 4 billion for the plant , india ' s largest single foreign direct investment at $ 2 . 9 billion .
the lenders ' consortium , led by industrial development bank of india , filed the petition on tuesday , the banker said .
dpc is 65 - percent owned by enron corp . , one of the world ' s biggest energy companies which is battling to calm investor worries about business deals being probed by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
general electric co and bechtel corp each hold 10 percent in dpc .
enron corp ' s shares fell 13 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 67 on wall street on tuesday in a further fallout of investor worries about the company . its stock has fallen 88 percent this year .
under the terms of another notice served by dpc on mseb in may , the two sides are locked in a negotiating period up to november 19 to try to resolve their dispute . enron has said it intends to sell its dpc stake to either the indian government or domestic lenders .
both domestic and foreign lenders have stopped disbursements to dpc , which dabhol says has reduced its ability to look after the plant .
"" we want to ensure that talks between prospective buyers and enron take place amicably . we believe if a final termination notice is served , it will precipitate the situation . we don ' t want this , "" the banker said .

india : tata power may ask lenders for loan write - off in dpc

mumbai , nov . 6 lenders to enron ' s dabhol power company ( dpc ) may have to write off "" part of "" their loans for potential buyers to remain interested in acquiring the project .
officials at tata power told business line that the company may ask lenders at a multilateral meeting to be held in singapore to write off "" part of "" the $ 1 . 9 - billion in loans to the 2 , 184 - mw project .
tata power had given an expression of interest to financial institutions last month . mumbai - based power utility , bses ltd , is the only other company which has publicly expressed interest in buying the project , albeit , at a substantial discount .
according to the sources , while the tatas have asked for writing off loans in addition to the earlier demand for increasing the moratorium on loan repayments and slashing of interest rates . rupee loans constitute over 65 per cent of the debt . domestic fis would be most affected if the loans were to be written off .
senior tata power officials , including mr adi engineer , managing director and mr phiroze vandrevala , deputy managing director , are leaving for singapore on wednesday to attend the negotiations . senior bureaucrats from the union ministries of finance and power are also expected to attend , apart from state and mseb officials .
according to sources , tata power will ask for a complete debt and equity restructuring for it to buy a stake in dpc . this also includes asking enron corporation to take a 50 per cent hit on its equity in dpc .
enron had earlier quoted a price of $ 1 . 2 billion for its stake . "" the tatas are looking at a figure of $ 600 million , "" sources said .
another matter of contention in the price quoted by enron includes the $ 0 . 22 - billion which account for "" retained earnings "" which have been added to the cost . according to the tatas , they are willing to pay only $ 0 . 8 billion of these "" retained earnings "" which include enron ' s much - talked about ' education charges ' .
the company will push for separate negotiations for the lng terminal and the power plant . enron had earlier said that it would not consider selling the project piecemeal and that the company picking up a stake in the project would have to buy the power plant along with lng terminal .
the company plans to negotiate the debt and equity factors to bring down power tariffs to an "" ideal price "" of rs 2 . 70 per unit to rs 2 . 90 per unit , sources said .

enron is poised to enter into confidentiality agreements with the two contenders tata power and bses prior to entering into serious negotiations . tata power and bses are the only two companies to have publicly evinced interest in buying enron ' s stake in dabhol power company ( dpc ) .
confirming the move a senior tata power executive said , "" the terms and conditions of the confidentiality agreement are under discussion . this will pave the way for future negotiations . ""
bses chairman and managing director r v shahi , however , said that he was "" not aware of any such move . "" the dpc spokesman could not be reached for comment . the stage seems to be set for hardcore negotiations to buy its equity in the beleaguered dpc . enron , which holds 65 per cent in dpc , has announced its intention to exit the project following payments dispute with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .
its two other us based partners general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each and they too have decided to exit the project . the balance stake is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle . enron , ge and bechtel have valued their combined 85 per cent stake at about $ 1 . 2 billion . it is learnt that bses is insisting on a steep discount but enron has so fare refused to budge . the mumbai - based power company is also negotiating for a reduction in the capital cost of the project by spinning off the 5 million tonne lng facility into a separate company . it ' s contention is that it can source gas by entering into supply agreements with other players who are setting up lng terminals on the west coast of india .

domestic lenders file lawsuit against enron ' s indian unit

( copyright 2001 )
bombay , nov 7 ( afp ) - indian banks and financial institutions which have lent money to us - based enron corp ' s controversial domestic subsidiary have filed a lawsuit to ensure they get the funds back , an enron official said wednesday .
the suit has been filed by state bank of india , icici ltd . , industrial development bank of india and ifci ltd . , which have given enron ' s three billion - dollar power project in western maharashtra 60 billion rupees ( 1 . 25 billion dollars ) in loans .
the suit comes a day after dabhol power served an "" asset transfer notice "" to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) for the valuation of the company ' s assets in order to sell these off .
enron corp , along with mseb and the state government of maharashtra , had jointly set up the project , which plunged into controversy after mseb failed to pay dabhol power for power purchased from the company .
the enron official said the bankers wanted immediate resumption of work at the plant which will ensure cash flow and help the owners pay their dues to the lenders .
dabhol power company said on tuesday it plans to issue the final termination notice to mseb after november 19 in order to formally close the plant .
enron holds a 65 - percent stake in dabhol power company , while mseb is the other stakeholder .

usa : wrapup - enron shares sink as company looks for cash .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 6 ( reuters ) - enron corp . shares sank below the $ 10 . 00 mark for the first time in nearly a decade on tuesday as the energy trading giant sought cash to calm investor worries about business deals being probed by federal regulators .
shares in the houston - based firm closed down $ 1 . 50 , or 13 . 4 percent , to $ 9 . 67 , a level not seen since may 1992 , as enron stock continued a downward spiral that has lopped off 88 percent of its value this year .
it was the most actively traded issue on the new york stock exchange , with 29 . 6 million shares changing hands , and the fourth - biggest percentage loser .
analysts attributed the drop to ongoing investor anxiety about the company ' s deteriorating credit ratings , which have been cut to near - junk levels and raised questions about enron ' s ability to continue to finance its business .
the company , which is the nation ' s no . 1 trader of natural gas and electricity , was once a wall street star , but has fallen under fire for failing to explain off - the - balance sheet transactions that led to a $ 1 billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity on oct . 16 . its stock has lost $ 18 . 5 billion in market value since that date .
the deals , conducted with partnerships run by then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , are under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission for possible conflicts - of - interest .
fastow took a leave of absence on oct . 24 in the latest of a growing line of high - profile departures topped by the august resignation of chief executive jeff skilling . he left after just six months on the job , saying he wanted a lifestyle change .
to bolster fading investor confidence , enron has been gathering cash and credit and trying to sell off assets to pay down debt .
the wall street journal reported on tuesday that enron had talked with private equity firms and rivals in the power - trading business about providing a capital infusion of at least $ 2 billion in exchange for an equity stake and other terms .
the infusion was needed , it said , because access to financing is drying up and asset sales are going slower than expected .
the report said enron had approached such buyout firms as blackstone group and clayton , dubilier & rice to gauge their interest and had gotten calls from a number of power traders , none of whom the paper could identify .
enron , blackstone , and clayton dubilier all declined comment . people familiar with the situation said clayton dubilier wasn ' t interested , but blackstone is willing to discuss an enron proposal .
a tough read
they said investors may be wary because enron ' s books are difficult to understand and therefore the depth of its problems unknown , but not lost on them is that last year the company had $ 100 billion in revenues and $ 1 . 4 billion in net earnings .
"" it ' s definitely an opportunity , "" said one advisor to private equity funds . "" it ' s a distressed situation and it has stable cash flow . ""
image experts said enron could make itself more attractive by responding fully to investor demands for more information , rather than clamming up as it has in recent days while it tries to get its house in order .
"" their perception is that there ' s obfuscation going on , in terms of senior people making pronouncements without fully understanding the nature of what they ' re talking about and that in turn gives the impression that they ' re hiding something , "" said john lister of lister butler consulting , a brand identity consulting firm .
he said the company should quit listening to lawyers and come clean .
"" what tends to happen in these situations is lawyers get inserted into the situation . the first thing a lawyer tells you is to shut up . and unfortunately that is the antithesis of what good brand stewardship requires , "" he said .

usa : buyout funds flock to enron ? might be a pipe dream .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 6 ( reuters ) - it ' s going to take a lot of sweet - talking to get private equity firms to pour cash into troubled energy trading giant enron corp . , buyout executives and industry watchers said on tuesday .
houston - based enron , whose shares have been hammered on concerns over credit problems and accounting practices , is reportedly seeking $ 2 billion from investors to bolster its balance sheet . on tuesday , its shares fell $ 1 . 50 , or 13 . 4 percent , to $ 9 . 67 , on the new york stock exchange , the lowest in nearly a decade .
leveraged buyout ( lbo ) firms , which specialize in buying large stakes in companies and help manage them for eventual sale , are typically reticent in buying stock in public companies . and worries over enron ' s accounting transparency could force investors to spend months on due diligence , delaying any short - term infusion , experts said .
"" enron is a tough one , "" said david stein , partner in the fund evaluation group , which advises private equity investors . "" they do so much esoteric stuff that it would take a long time to figure out . ""
enron said last week it had obtained $ 1 billion in secured credit lines from j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney . however , the wall street journal reported the company is seeking some $ 2 billion in cash from major buyout firms such as blackstone group and clayton dubilier & rice in return for an equity stake in enron .
enron , blackstone , and clayton dubilier all declined comment . however , people familiar with the situation said clayton dubilier wasn ' t interested and blackstone is willing to discuss an enron proposal .
private equity executives echoed the view that the lack of transparency in enron ' s accounting would pose a serious hazard in effectively valuing the company as a precursor to an investment .
"" it would take a long time to figure out , "" said one executive with a major u . s . buyout firm . even potential buyers of enron assets say they have been baffled by enron ' s financial reporting .
"" our lawyers looked at some of enron ' s stuff in the past and walked away shaking their heads , "" said an executive with a competing firm who asked to remain anonymous .
however , buyout executives didn ' t reject such an investment outright . despite problems that have driven enron ' s shares down from $ 75 on jan . 3 , the company still generated $ 100 billion in revenue last year and $ 1 . 4 billion in net earnings , mostly from huge trading operations in electricity and natural gas .
"" it ' s definitely an opportunity , "" said one advisor to private equity funds . "" it ' s a distressed situation and it has stable cash flow . "" but , this advisor added , "" if the accounting is questionable , you have some serious issues there . you are basing your investing on the numbers the company has provided . ""
if blackstone did invest in enron , it would be a step away from its traditional strategy of buying controlling stakes in private companies for eventual sale .
"" our limited partners ( investors ) don ' t like this kind of investing , in general , so you have to have a compelling reason , "" said steven schwarzman , blackstone ' s chief executive and co - founder , at a recent conference in new york .
most private equity funds say their pension fund investors prefer they don ' t invest in public stocks , since those investors could just as easily buy the stocks themselves without paying fees to the buyout firm .
however , some buyout firms , like warburg pincus llc , have lately made a push into public stock investing , known as private investments into public equities ( pipes ) , finding that the market meltdown in the last year has made valuations overly attractive .
blackstone ' s schwarzman said pipe investing is like being "" savaged , if the underlying security goes down . ""

usa : enron shows few signs of restoring battered image .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 6 ( reuters ) - enron corp . says it is working hard to restore shattered investor confidence , but shareholders and consultants see precious little of the disclosure they consider the company needs to rebuild its reputation .
the energy trading giant ' s credibility with investors has been badly tarnished and its stock price has sunk to lows last seen in 1992 , as investors clamor for more information about off - balance sheet transactions . the dealings led to a $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity that enron disclosed three weeks ago .
though enron promised a week after the unexpected write - down was announced to be more transparent , there is still little sign of greater disclosure . sightings of chief executive kenneth lay have been few and far between .
he dropped a scheduled appearance at a u . s . - british business meeting in houston last week , and repeated requests for interviews with him have been rebuffed .
meanwhile , wall street is voting with its feet and enron ' s stock continues to sink . the stock fell 13 . 43 percent on tuesday alone and it is now down 88 percent this year . in the past three weeks , $ 18 . 5 billion has been wiped off the company ' s market value .
"" the perception is that there ' s obfuscation going on , in terms of senior people making pronouncements without fully understanding the nature of what they ' re talking about and that in turn gives the impression that they ' re hiding something , "" said john lister of lister butler consulting , a brand identity consulting firm .
since investors began dumping enron securities three weeks ago , the company has made few visible moves to answer some of the calls for accountability .
it held a conference call two weeks ago and set up a committee last week to examine its finances and communicate with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , which has launched a probe into enron ' s murky transactions .
enron has maintained it is being forthright with investors , despite a barrage of criticism .
"" we recognize that our credibility has been damaged and we are working on investor concerns , "" a company spokeswoman said .
' trust came undone '
enron , which is garnering bad press on an almost - daily basis , does not seem to realize just how badly its once - shining reputation has eroded , consultants said . if it does , it is failing to act accordingly , they said .
"" wall street gave them a high degree of credibility . they enjoyed that trust for a long time , but that trust came undone , "" said john mccormack , head of consulting firm stern stewart and co . ' s energy practice .
"" confidence takes a long time , years if not decades . but it can be destroyed very quickly , "" he said .
even the special committee has not gone far enough , some investors said . the afl - cio umbrella labor union body , whose affiliates hold an estimated 3 . 1 million shares of enron , wrote to lay and william powers , the committee ' s chairman , making further demands .
those demands included the examination of all transactions with entities in which enron employees or directors have an interest , adopting procedures for reviewing insider participation in investments , beginning a review of executive compensation and adopting a stricter definition of director independence .
beth young , a consultant to the afl - cio , said most special committees set up to examine a company ' s actions try to show they have wide jurisdiction , a lot of power and that company executives can ' t stand in their way .
but she said enron has defined the committee ' s mission too narrowly , and she worried it would not examine other third - party transactions the company has that could be potential conflicts of interest .
lister advocates as much transparency as possible .
"" the only way they can do that under the circumstances is to have a senior officer with a well - crafted story and they must give the impression that they are telling the truth , "" he said .
"" what tends to happen in these situation is lawyers get inserted into the situation . the first thing a lawyer tells you is to shut up . and unfortunately that is the antithesis of what good brand stewardship requires , "" lister added .

enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) really starting to shock me now . as bad as i think it is , and i think it is plenty bad , i think enron ' s got some value . i wonder if you can ' t take a flier for two bucks and change and buy both the nov . 10 puts and calls .
here ' s my reasoning : this stock is in flux . nobody knows what ' s going to happen . i think the company is worth a huge amount on a takeout . but if the wheels are really falling off , it is not going to stop here .
this two - buck - and - change play allows you a call and a put on the next 10 days ' worth of action , 10 decisive days that i think will definitely determine the fate of this darned thing .

it just doesn ' t happen that way .

i like wind .
i have two people pursuing opportunities . elliot mainzer and scott healy . elliot managed our structuring group and has been interested in renewables for some time so tim and i pushed him out of his nest and gave him a mandate to start a renewables desk . his vision is to make a market for green power and start a renewables power exchange ( "" rpx "" ) on eol . scott is a generalist originator but developed wind projects prior to joining enron so i have pulled him in to work with elliot .
in this high - priced market , wind is economic . wind development is able to come online quicker than nat gas . the challenges are related to firming , or at least being able to pre - schedule the energy . bpa , pacificorp and ladwp have expressed interest in taking intermittent wind energy and redelivering it to a market point with a weekly pre - schedule . they charge approximately $ 10 / mwh for this service . given the value of supply , we are trying to buy energy or partner in development . current supply initiatives :
- executed mou with enexco / cinergy for joint development - non - binding , epmi markets , enexco builds and operates ; cinergy provides equity
- proposed to pacificorp purchase of 50 mw block from their stateline project
- proposed to ene wind purchase of energy from four of their ca projects
- proposed to ene wind the purchase of one of their pnw sites
- discussions with morongo tribe re joint ca development
demand is coming from municipal and investor utilities , bpa , dwr , select fortune 50 industrials with green portfolio requirements . bpa put out an rfp for 1000 mw . we are meeting with municipal utilities to promote the concept of the rpx and to get some notional long - term bids .
this has all heated up in the last two months , but i like the fundamentals and i think we will have a small , profitable new business by the end of the year .

we received two financing commitment letters from hancock . in general , the letters are good and suggest that hancock is genuinely in the deal , but they include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals . chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get hancock to call ben glisan to assure us that they are in ( hancock wants a lot of future business from enron ) . in the meantime , we are innovatively stalling ge by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them . i think we will get both sides of this trade done .

"Subject: california controller refuses to pay tab for cdwr staff ' s sushi and
pizza
blackouts don ' t justify takeout , connell says
by ed fletcher
bee capitol bureau
( published july 25 , 2001 )
while operating in "" crisis "" mode , department of water resources staff worked 20 - hour days , slept in conference rooms and were fed pizza and sushi by the state as the department tried to keep california ' s lights on .
saying the department "" charged enough to feed a small army , "" state controller kathleen connell now is asking those employees to pay the state back about $ 3 , 600 for department food purchases in january .
"" we are not going to be paying these bills , "" connell told reporters tuesday .
the state does not buy business - hour meals for staff while they are in town , connell said . additionally , the use of a government - issued credit card to make the purchases was improper , she said . if the department does not require the employees to pay for the takeout meals , she said , the department will have to absorb the cost .
the department of water resources began scrambling to buy power jan . 17 after gov . gray davis declared a state of emergency - - the same day northern california was hit with rolling power blackouts . as a result of the department ' s new responsibility , staff members buying power were asked to work nearly around the clock , said oscar hidalgo , a department spokesman .
buying food for staff during crisis situations is nothing out of the norm , hidalgo said .
"" under emergencies such as these . . . we believe we were in a position to do this . our staff did nothing other than it would do during a flood , "" hidalgo said .
california ' s recent success in keeping the lights on has led people to forget the level of crisis the state was in , hidalgo said . "" it seems at every turn . . . people are making monday morning quarterback calls , "" he said .
connell and her aides said buying power is not the same as firefighters getting food while battling a blaze .
they said using the "" cal - card "" for buying food is specifically prohibited . "" it ' s not an open line of credit , "" she said .

tanya , naveen ,
just a thought . changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes
of prices and positions .
this happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas
portfolio . a big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day , combined with a moderate price
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big .
if the volumetric position was frozen , it ' s just a scaling factor and there
should be
no discrepancy between your numbers . of course , the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes .

we care about portfolio value changes , not log - returns of a
single contract , which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a
fat - tailed distribution . a 1 . 20 basis move , with 500 bcf position , is an
extreme event , anyway you slice it . in the literature , as elsewhere , i agree
for a single contract log - returns , they don ' t divide by vols .

i got ngi - socal prices for prompt , prompt + 1 , . . . , prompt + 59 contracts .
for each contract i calculated moving average based on 21 log - returns as
well as moving volatility . then i calculated normalized log - returns :
[ return ( t ) - ave ( t ) ] / vol ( t )
and compared the results to normal distribution .
i could not find fat tails !
volatility changes a lot from day to day , so when people look at
log - returns ( not normalized ) it seems that there fat tails ( big spikes , large
returns more frequent than normal ) ,
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant ( at all ) .

"Subject: presentation - integrating market risk and credit risk
all ,
i will be giving a 40 min presentation on the above topic at the eprm energy
2000 conference in april . the bulletpoints are :
balancing market risk and credit risk to achieve a reliable estimation of
total risk
incorporating market risk into a credit risk model
calculating probability of default using credit risk and market risk
refining business practice to reflect credit risk and market risk evaluations
my proposed approach is to quickly step through the practical process of
modelling credit risk , resulting in measures for expected loss and
credit - var ; then show how default probs can be calculated using bond and
equity data . finally i ' ll describe how credit risk can be mitigated using
credit derivatives - plugging enroncredit . com of course .
any other ideas for broad topics and / or specific points to mention will be
appreciated . the presentation has to be submitted next week .
many thanks ,

subject : confidential attorney client work product
with respect to the segregation of funds in mexico to pay for potential labor liabilities as requested by john lavorato , below is my proposed plan .
1 - we obtain a legal opinion from mexican counsel explaining the legal obligation of any mexican company to pay for labor liabilities and summarizing the possible liabilities for directors in case such liabilities are not paid for .
2 - the shareholders of enron servicios pass a resolution memorializing the desire to comply with mexican law and resolving to open a segregated bank account to pay for any and all possible labor liabilities . this bank account can only be accessed by any two directors of enron servicios signing jointly ( this is my suggestion and can obviously be different ) .
3 - our lawyers in mexico will open the account and funds will be transferred forthwith .
4 - the resolution and the bank account will not be public record and no employee should know about these funds ( we need to see how we can send funds to this bank account without any mexico employee ' s signature )
purpose : ( i ) document our legal obligations in accordance with mexican law and the reason why the shareholders of the company wish to segregate funds and ( ii ) make sure nobody besides the directors can access these funds . if the segregation of funds is ever challenged by ene or ena ' s creditors , we will have the legal background and justification for the segregation .
if this is okay with you , i will have the various resolutions and proxies ready for signature tomorrow and the account could probably be open and funded by thursday .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments . thanks

"Subject: analyst / associate program update breakfast meeting
many exciting things have happened since i last emailed you about the program . today , i will highlight the results of the recent program survey and discuss several initiatives we have underway . i also want to invite each of you to attend one of four meetings we ' ve scheduled to discuss the information below in greater detail , and to provide you with an opportunity for q & a .
program survey
i want thank everyone who participated in the program survey a few weeks ago . as promised , i also want to communicate the results of the feedback you provided . in short , we ' ve made progress over the past 5 months in a number of areas , but there are still things that we can improve on . below are some summary points about the survey , and how the results compare to the last program survey in october 2000 .
we surveyed all members of the western hemisphere program , business unit supervisors and prc reps , and summer interns .
response rates of about 40 % were consistent with last year .
when asked about overall satisfaction with the program , "" favorable "" responses from associates improved to 58 % from 27 % , and from analysts improved to 46 % from 41 % . "" unfavorable "" responses also improved for both groups ( associates to 8 % from 41 % last year , and analysts to 13 % from 29 % ) .
similar improvements were noted in the responses from the business units . when asked about overall satisfaction with the program , "" favorable "" responses improved to 69 % from 49 % , and "" unfavorable "" responses improved to 3 % from 24 % .
areas for improvement most frequently mentioned included rotation management , compensation , performance review process , and communication . we have activities in progress to continue improvement in each of these areas .
initiatives
below are some highlights of several things that will "" roll - out "" over the next few weeks , and many of them reflect your input to the program through survey feedback , as well as meetings that i ' ve had with many of you .
a new , online rotation information and management system is in development and should be ready for delivery during the 4 th quarter .
compensation packages have been revised for the current recruiting season . an equity adjustment for current members of the program is set for february 2002 , several months ahead of the new class start dates .
we made significant changes to the prc process at mid - year . at this time we are working with hr on further improvements which will be implemented for the year - end process .
on the communication front several things are happening . the associate / analyst program newsletter will return later this month . the format will be a concise email similar to the entouch newsletter used by wholesale , and global flash in europe . a new external website for the program was launched last week ( access it via www . enron . com ) . a new internal website is expected to be operational by the end of september . we are also planning espeak and brown bag sessions this fall to talk in greater detail about things like recruiting , the prc process , and other topics of interest . we will also continue the pizza lunch schedule .
an updated social and community service activity schedule has been completed , and we are working on a more integrated approach to training and development for the program .
program meetings
i invite each of you to select and attend one of the meetings listed below , where i will discuss in greater detail the information i ' ve highlighted above . each meeting will be held in eb 5 c 2 , and will run from 7 : 30 to 8 : 30 am . a continental breakfast will be provided . because space in this room is limited , pls rsvp to my assistant maxine levingston by the dates listed below . maxine can be reached by email at maxine . e . levingston @ enron . com .
friday , sept 21 7 : 30 - 8 : 30 am eb 5 c 2 ( rsvp no later than 12 : 00 noon , thursday sept 20 )
tuesday , sept 25 7 : 30 - 8 : 30 am eb 5 c 2 ( rsvp no later than 12 : 00 noon , monday sept 24 )

weak oil fundamentals weighing on price
two forces are vying for control of oil market psychology since september 11 - -
fear of recession and fear of military action . currently , the fear of recession
and its implications for oil demand is in ascendance because military action
remains in preparatory mode thus far .
* an escalation of military action would revive the initial concerns that a us
military response could affect production in the middle east .
* the terrorist attack of september 11 is delivering a shock to the us economy
with ramifications in the oil market . cera has revised downward sharply its
demand outlook in the wake of the attacks .
* opec producers are also growing more concerned about market share . our
outlook assumes that opec does not agree to a further cut at its september 26
meeting in vienna .

subject : re : tenaska
that sounds great . because of the accrual , i cannot draft this today . i
will try it on monday . what about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska
iv . do you think that is a good idea ? i explained it to kris hanson and she
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable . we would need a new
demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of
$ 2 , 803 , 586 . 41 with no volume and no commodity . this is more than we owe
tenaska iv , but i will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $ 0 . 04 demand
fee to pay a net amount of $ 1 , 551 , 050 . 76 . i have attached my spreadsheet
which details our payment . we will have to adjust this number once we get
the actual volumes . i would like to pay tenaska iv next week , so please let
me what you think .
thanks ,

"Subject: rto orders - grid south , se trans , spp and entergy
the southeast rto orders are out and have followed through with what we expected from the discussion at the ferc meeting .
the spp and entergy rto proposals have been rejected because they fail to satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of order no . 2000 . the commission notes that the required discussions between spp and entergy and its neighboring rto / tos has led to no increase in the original scope and configuration . the filings by spp and entergy were brief , indicating only a lack of interest by other rtos or utilities in joining to enlarge scope ; they failed to specify any details of the talks , what changes could be made or what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other rtos . the order states that the commission favors the development of large , regional transmission organizations reflecting natural markets . the commission indicates that they favor four rtos - ne , se , mw and west . therefore the order requires the participants in spp and entergy to participate in settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order . note that these meetings will start next tuesday , july 17 before a ferc alj .
the southern company rto is also found by the ferc to fail the scope characteristics of order no . 2000 . the order finds that southern ' s approach to focus on mous and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate . the order states , "" we reiterate : the commission ' s goal is to have a single rto in the southeast , and to have that single rto operational as soon as possible . "" the commission recognizes that start - up costs in forming a larger rto may be more , but that over the longer term , large rtos will foster market development , will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices . the order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above .
the grid south participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next tuesday . it is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of rtos , including independent board requirement , congestion managment , interconnection procedures , planning process and cbm . therefore , i am attaching a summary of the order . one of the important findings of the order is that gridsouth is not sufficiently independent ; the applicant tos are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board . therefore , the order requires gridsouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within 90 days .
if anyone wants copies of the orders , let me know .",0

"Subject: california power 2 / 8
please contact kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) or robert johnston ( x 39934 ) for further clarification .
executive summary :
utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles - agreement on payback for the bailout , rate increases , and further short - term funding for dwr purchases of power .
disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities . the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets .
the economics of the long - term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period .
air quality management district regulations are under review , but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity .
legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left - wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow , if not stop , davis ' s bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton ' s eminent domain threats against generators , which reflect this pressure , are of little significance .
1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again
a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state , the utilities , and their creditors , with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday .
socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard to keep cash on - hand , and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs , they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy .
opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely , but that everything will be resolved during that 50 - day period . senator john burton "" is in no hurry "" to reach a deal with the utilities , as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to "" strong - arm "" the utilities . burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated , "" bankruptcy would be bad , but not the worst thing possible . "" he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities .
still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on :
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday )
additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may .
there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend .
additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund .
2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt
while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants .
no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer .
3 . long - term contracts
as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years .
assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "" tablet from on high "" from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 .
these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line .
according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary .
4 . air quality district exemptions
there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government .
currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow "" dirtier "" plants to
come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the
use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) .
5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates
the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout .
6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect
the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable .
7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze
many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash .
ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .",0

with respect to your questions concerning the heartland industrial partners fund and current investments :
heartland is a private equity buyout fund with $ 1 . 2 billion in commitments . the targeted size of the fund is $ 2 billion . the fund is headed by david stockman , former managing director at the blackstone group . stockman was director of omb under reagan .
heartland ' s objective is an irr of 30 % gross ( 26 % to the limited partners ) . the limiteds get an 8 % preferred return after which the gp gets a 20 % carried return . the gp also receives a 1 . 5 % management fee . in my experience these terms are consistent with most private equity funds .
the fund ' s objective is to acquire and expand industrial companies "" in sectors ripe for consolidation and growth . "" these "" industrial platform scaleups "" are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials , automotive suppliers , capital goods , chemicals , plastics conversion , metal working , etc .
the fund has two investments currently :
mascotech is a merger of three fund companies . it is a leading global designer and supplier of high quality , low - cost metal formed components , assemblies and modules for the transportation industry . products include noise vibration and harshness products , transmission and transfer case components , engine components , wheel end and suspension components , axle driveline components . estimated revenues were $ 1 . 9 billion in 2001 . the company has 50 facilities in 11 countries . 9 , 500 employees .
an agreement to purchase collins & aikman corporation was signed in january 2001 . c & a is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a leading supplier of automotive fabric , interior trim and convertible top systems with 2000 sales of $ 1 . 9 billion .
the original dash in april 2000 predicated that "" ena will receive the exclusive right to provide all energy - related products and services to each platform company owned by the fund . . . ena will submit a comprehensive , long - term , energy managment plan for each platform company . hip will be obligated to accept and implement the plan as long as the plan provides a cost benefit relative to the platform company ' s current practices after accounting for switching costs . the expected value of this business to ena is about $ 20 - 50 mm .

dave ,
congrats on your new role . heartland industrial partners was an investment pursued solely for the purpose of providing deal flow for energy outsourcing opportunities when ena ' s industrial group was following a broad based energy outsourcing business plan . it has zero relevance to eim ' s business . in fact , heartland has been reflected on ena ' s balance sheet ever since the creation of eim last august . brad dunn has administered the relationship as a transitional matter in the intervening months . brad has attempted to get ees to take on the transaction , but they have expressed no interest in the capital commitment . however , ees wants the option to look at the energy outsourcing opportunities in the transaction . if i thought i could get a free option , i would take the same position . if enron is to get anything out of heartland industrial partners beyond the return on our invested dollars , that value will come to ees . since there is no paper or steel aspect to heartland , it doesn ' t belong in eim and i don ' t want it . i would be happy to discuss .
on a different note , there are lots of opportunities for ees and eim to work together on ( i ) energy opportunities in eim ' s pulp colwell , wes ; raymond bowen / hou / ect @ enron

richard , it is my understanding that this investment is currently in ray bowen ' s business . in my ena shoes , i would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility . in my ees shoes , i would like to take a closer look at the possible connections . please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio .
i have also heard that tom white has been talking to you about ees taking on the catalytica investment . with my ees shoes on , no way ! ! ! !

dave , in may 2000 enron north america committed to invest up to $ 30 million in heartland industrial partners l . p . , a private equity fund . the terms of the fund investment are fairly typical ( and not particularly exciting for a limited partner such as we ) . the deal was "" sold "" on the basis of ena getting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by the fund if these were cost effective . the claimed benefits for the energy management tie were calculated at $ 20 - 50 million . the deal was originated by brad dunn who now is in eim . ownership of this commitment had been assigned to jim ajello .
the kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now provided by ees . while they are happy to exploit any opportunity , their business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind of deal . in short , they have no interest in picking up the commitment ( and capital employed ) via an intercompany transfer .
private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years . the heartland partnership has a 10 - year life , enron did negotiate the right to sell its lp interest after 3 years . as a practical matter , that right guarantees neither a fair price or even a market .
there is no logical home for this investment that i know of in ena except in my portfolio . question : is this an ena responsibility or would it move to eim ' s balance sheet ? if we ( ena ) have no choice but to retain the investment , my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize funds invested to - date ( about $ 6 million ) and sell the remaining commitment . since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests , however , it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment / commitment in the foreseeable future . under any circumstances finding a buyer will be time - consuming and expensive . ( this is a poster child for "" patient "" investment capital ) .
i want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is that the obligation should be transferred to eim which i believe has assumed the charter of the ena group that formerly managed this investment . dick .

please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh
( x 39510 ) with additional questions .
executive summary
an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of
long - term contracts ( price and term ) .
the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan
to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .
audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred
to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless
appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the
pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well
as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .
davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him
with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california
consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .
davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a
ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate
hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .
legislation and bail out
bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations
yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,
specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has
received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill
is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said
davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .
bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear
today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of
the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .
according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court
battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a
settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc
case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to
california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the
ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the
two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that
california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity
charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot
initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .
a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase
and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline
usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would
still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %
of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important
sense .
making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night
when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many
customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .
the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was
met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation
policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious
efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think
there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,
something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .
long - term contracts
a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the
negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying
contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those
contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be
surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series
of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one
official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first
contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,
' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake
loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""
bankruptcy
because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that
california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for
socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments
to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement
among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .
we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost
by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los
angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for
elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at
the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to
square all the various circles of this crisis .
audit results and ballot initiatives
markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies
themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will
launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all
electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition
initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the
california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours
confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since
mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of
the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to
itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells
power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in
profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its
stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even
while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .
the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e
management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to
"" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep
spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors
also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its
profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,
which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .
"" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put
it yesterday .
what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is
actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough
rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without
triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among
a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making
this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and
the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the
spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular
political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by
the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely
difficult .
keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key
to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior
legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential
disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full
public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities
successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before
that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during
that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as
businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .
court battle
thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of
the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in
mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7
billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders
of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians
could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start
of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his
political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the
utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .
pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed
to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they
have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them
raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996
deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid
so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they
needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .
although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until
february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline
approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,
political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher
electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they
also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would
force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have
soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this
card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final
bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in
mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and
easily . ""
one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a
settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the
next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could
keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps
even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and
get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we
have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme
court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think
the creditors will be quite that patient . """,0

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - despite assurances from many companies that the removal of enron corp . ( ene ) from north american energy markets was proceeding in an orderly fashion , enron havoc broke loose friday morning .
cleaning up the mess will be nearly unbearable for energy industry employees for a few weeks because enron was involved in so many trades . but industry workers don ' t expect electric reliability to be threatened or gas supplies to be disrupted . what ' s more , the free market ' s ability to resolve problems most efficiently and to keep infrastructure humming will shine .
the lull after wednesday morning ' s collapse of dynegy inc . ' s ( dyn ) acquisition of enron was deceptive . on thursday afternoon , mirant ( mir ) told enron it would make no more power and gas deliveries to the company starting saturday , the first day of the new month . a couple of other companies followed suit by friday morning .
enron in turn began to lose its ability to meet its obligations as a supplier , because it doesn ' t produce much electricity . to meet sales obligations , it buys from producers and other traders . the positive feedback system is expected to spiral upwards until early next week , when enron could be almost totally out of the energy market .
to get an idea of how messy this all is , look at one troubled transaction thursday for saturday delivery of electricity to a utility . the utility bought power from sempra energy ( sre ) , which had bought it from el paso ( epg ) , which bought from dynegy ( dyn ) , which bought from pg 201 - 938 - 4604 ;

embattled energy - trading concern enron corp . is still considering all of its options , including the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 , people close to the matter said . such a decision , however , won ' t occur before next week , these people said .
some enron employees are being told not to expect any action over the weekend , these people said .
the chapter 11 process is designed to hold a company ' s creditors at bay while it hammers out a plan to reduce debt . although people familiar with the situation insist an all - out liquidation - - known as a chapter 7 filing - - isn ' t in the cards , some industry observers continue to speculate that the beleaguered company may be forced to go that route .
with its energy - trading business crippled by the downgrade wednesday of most of its debt to junk status and a buyout by dynegy inc . ( dyn ) called off later that day , enron ' s fortunes have been in a downward spiral .
as of 4 p . m . est friday on the new york stock exchange , shares of enron ( ene ) dropped 10 cents , or 28 % , to 26 cents . the stock had traded above $ 90 a share last year , and , all told , equity shareholders have lost over $ 60 billion .
enron ' s outstanding bonds trade at prices of around 15 cents on the dollar . the selloff in enron ' s bonds - - down from the upper 50 - cent range before wednesday ' s developments - - suggests bondholders don ' t expect much if any recovery on their investments .
there is little doubt that any bankruptcy proceedings will be complex and time - consuming , given the nearly $ 62 billion in assets on enron ' s balance sheet , as of its last quarterly financial report . also , the bankruptcy court would have to wade through and untangle many items not listed on its balance sheet . those financing vehicles are what sparked the company ' s troubles last month .
enron ' s liabilities are still a matter of debate . the company has an estimated $ 13 billion in debt on its balance sheet , and a further $ 7 billion in financings off the balance sheet . however , there may be other obligations lurking in connection with its investment partnerships .
since the debt downgrade , enron ' s trading business appears damaged beyond repair . without a viable credit rating , the company no longer has access to the reams of cash it needs to run that business .
underscoring enron ' s woes , the company told some of its trading partners on friday that it will default on some of its deliveries of wholesale electricity under contract for sunday and monday , people familiar with the situation said .
some observers had expected enron to file for bankruptcy protection as early as this week . but the people close to the situation said the complex business structure is slowing the process . where the company would file is also a question : the houston - based company could file where it is headquartered , but it is incorporated in oregon , and many companies look to the favorable courts of delaware whenever possible .
enron hired restructuring and bankruptcy specialist blackstone group late last week to advise it on corporate matters and to help restructure its debt .
the company also is being advised by law firm weil gotshal & manges , a bankruptcy specialist .
key supplier stops delivery
mirant corp . ( mir ) stopped delivering all power and natural gas to enron sold under existing contracts world - wide , traders and people familiar with the situation said .
the move brings enron ' s struggles in north america to a new level . until now , most companies had stopped making new trades with enron , but continued to deliver under their previously done deals . and enron has been delivering under its contracts in north america .
through thursday , enron was able to get third parties to step in and buy from mirant and sell to enron . in one transaction , for power to be delivered saturday , silicon valley power stepped into the middle . silicon valley power , the municipal utility of santa clara , calif . , confirmed thursday that it had done so .
"" that transaction for saturday is based on a contractual obligation we made to enron in the past , when enron was on a positive trading position with us , "" said silicon valley ' s marketing manager , larry owens .
energy - market sources expect other companies to follow suit with mirant , and they don ' t expect enron will be able to find intervening third parties for much longer . companies have the legal right to suspend deliveries if they reasonably expect they won ' t get paid .
to date , enron has paid its bills on time . saturday gas and power deliveries carry more risk than deals for delivery even friday , as enron won ' t have to pay for deliveries starting dec . 1 until late january .
a spokesmen for enron wouldn ' t comment . "" we don ' t discuss activities with individual counterparties , "" spokesman eric thode said .
layoffs begin in europe
enron officials said friday the company will lay off all but a handful of its european employees .
a few staff will be retained to wind up the remaining operations of enron in europe , which are now largely under the court - appointed administration of .
a statement issued by said "" approximately 1 , 100 redundancies have been made in the u . k . across the group , with 250 staff retained . ""
there was no word on the fate of enron ' s employees elsewhere in europe .
"" the over - riding priority is to preserve the valuable parts of the business and to reduce the cash needs of the business whilst seeking to secure the future of certain enron businesses and its employees , "" senior administrator tony lomas said in the statement .
separately , as of friday , two of enron ' s divisions - - enron capital and trade resources ltd . and enron gas and petrochemical trading ltd . - - were in default regarding their obligations under the united kingdom ' s balancing and settlement code , although u . k . balancing market operator elexon stressed that regulators decided not to expel enron from trading at this time .
"" the panel will meet again on dec . 5 to further discuss enron , and have the right to review their decision not to expel enron at any time before that , "" said a spokeswoman for elexon .
in addition , german grid operators cancelled their grid - access contracts with enron capital & trade resources , effectively excluding it from all transactions that involve delivery to , or transit through germany , europe ' s largest power market and an essential part of enron ' s european power activities .
enron also has been suspended from trading on nord pool , the ukpx , the amsterdam power exchange , the european energy exchange and the automated power exchange ' s u . k . contracts .

tables turned as commercial banks lick enron wounds

dow jones capital markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - after enduring one of the toughest operating environments in recent years , investment bankers can at least raise a smile that commercial banks are bearing the brunt of the fallout from the anticipated collapse of energy trading house enron corp . ( ene ) .
the likelihood that enron will file for what would be a messy bankruptcy is "" sure to illustrate one of the fundamental differences between commercial banks and investment banks , "" noted analysts van hesser and justin ziegler at credit suisse first boston in new york .
the appetite of commercial banks for more exposure to an individual name than their investment banking rivals is evident in a breakdown of the direct loan exposures to enron , a list that ' s dominated by commercial banks .
according to ratings agency fitch , j . p . morgan chase has $ 500 million in unsecured exposure and at least a further $ 400 million that is secured . citigroup ( c ) , is gauged at having $ 800 million in exposure with $ 500 secured and $ 300 million unsecured by fitch . and another leading commercial entity , bank of america corp ( bac ) , is believed to have $ 300 million in direct loan exposure as at sept . 30 , note csfb .
extending loans to companies that can run into problems , "" is definitely the risk in commercial banking , but such banks are well diversified and able to absorb these situations , "" said ken worthington , director and equity analyst at cibc world markets in new york .
however , in the case of j . p . morgan chase "" which prides itself on passing credit risk off to others through various means , including loan syndications and hedging , this is a stunning figure , "" said kathy shanley , bank and finance analyst at gimme credit , an independent credit research firm in new york .
in recent years , commercial banks have sought to leverage their diversified structures by aggressively muscling into the territory of investment banks . they sought to underwrite corporate bond and stock issues - the traditional turf of investment banks - by offering commercial banking sweetners such as lines of credit and loans .
investment banks do not enjoy the benefit of a substantial balance sheet and tend to focus on underwriting and generally don ' t provide loans . and while investment banks have been forced by competitive pressures to extend lending facilities - demonstrated by morgan stanley ' s credit facilities to lucent technologies - "" they usually offload their balance sheet exposures in order to lower their risk profile , "" said worthington .
this in turn underlines the more selective approach that investment banks have to financial markets than their commercial banking cousins . while investment banks are not gun - shy of building risk exposures , the csfb analysts believe "" they tend to build fewer and they tend to be more disciplined about it . ""
this helps explain why in respect to enron , csfb believes "" broker exposures are relatively light . "" the bank expects exposure to enron at goldman sachs group ( gs ) , and morgan stanley ( mwd ) "" to be in the $ 50 to $ 100 million range , while other major securities houses such as bear stearns companies inc ( bsc ) , lehman brothers ( leh ) and merrill lynch & co . ( mer ) "" should have exposures that are relatively immaterial . ""
but the carnage at enron has left some investment bankers looking better off than the gungho commercial banks who sought juicy m & a fees by providing creditlines to the company as it planned its ultimately doomed merger with dynegy inc . ( dyn ) . as citi and jpm face the prospect of a battle over the assets of enron in a bankruptcy filing , "" goldman sachs sits on the sidelines with a cheshire cat grin , reminding investors it declined to extend a credit line to enron as a condition of signing on as a merger advisor , "" noted gimme credit ' s shanley .
the travails surrounding enron and the big commercial banks , "" reads like a case study dreamed up by the securities industry association to illustrate why banks should never have been allowed in the investment banking business in the first place , "" she said .
although goldman and morgan stanley have "" meaningful energy trading operations , "" csfb believe that both banks are well versed in hedging and structuring collaterized trading agreements . such methods limit the potential for gaping losses associated with failure of a counterparty to trades previously transacted .
worthington at cibc added , "" what really drives the business of investment banking are relationships and talent . ""
but mired at the bottom of the investment banking cycle , many firms have been looking to combine their talented workforce with the attractive balance sheets of commercial banks in order to enhance their operation . they ' ve looked to the success of citigroup ' s vaunted one - stop shopping model , which combines banking services with the investment banking offerings of salomon smith barney .
although fitch notes "" the banking industry ' s stated exposures do not appear , in and of themselves , significant enough to have ratings implications , "" the news from enron is perhaps a timely reminder that cultivating a big balance sheet also carries certain risks .
that ' s not to say investment banking won ' t undergo further consolidation that involves finding large balance sheets . the search for profits and economies of scale from building a joint commercial and investment banking franchise are the stuff of many bankers ' dreams .
indeed , many analysts believe merrill lynch

enron collapse could weigh heavy on some insurers

new york - ( dow jones ) - the insurance industry didn ' t need enron corp . ' s ( ene ) problems , particularly when it comes to reinsurance prices .
primary insurers could be on the hook for as much as $ 2 billion in claims against directors and officers policies , surety bonds and financial guarantees related to the houston energy trading firm , which , among its options , is considering seeking chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . some insurers also will likely take a hit in their investment portfolios if enron defaults on its bond payments .
the loss would be material , but not devastating for the industry . however , amid the backdrop of the world trade center disaster , enron ' s impact could pressure some firms going forward , particularly if most of their enron risk was ceded to reinsurers . "" this event is likely to exacerbate the ( reinsurance ) capacity shortfall in the market that already exists , making 2002 one of the more , if not the most , powerful pricing years in recent history , "" said alice schroeder , a morgan stanley insurance analyst .
reinsurance prices were rising prior to the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . rates are expected to rise dramatically in light of the events as reinsurers get a handle on how to insure this new risk in the u . s .
aviation rates , for example , have already climbed 200 % to 300 % in some cases . reinsurers also are willing to take on less risk , forcing primary insurers to keep more of the coverage or write policies offering less coverage .
chubb corp . ( cb ) , a warren , n . j . , insurer , said it was reviewing its surety bonds related to enron and could have a maximum net pretax exposure under outstanding surety bonds of about $ 220 million . the firm said its after - tax exposure is $ 143 million , or 82 cents a share .
a company takes out a surety bond in the event it can ' t fulfill a contractual obligation . typically , surety bonds would pay out any monetary guarantees if a company was unable do so . surety bonds are often used to improve a firm ' s credit rating .
the insurer was unable to estimate the actual amount , if any , that they may be required to pay or the timing of those payments because of contingencies , including the actions of others , possible judicial rulings or the amounts that chubb may recover under surety bond documents . no claims have yet been filed under the surety bonds .
jay cohen , a merrill lynch analyst , said chubb ' s surety bond obligations in regards to enron generally guaranteed the delivery of natural gas to energy producers , such as utilities . each bond could have different defined events that would trigger a claim , such as a bankruptcy , cohen said .
"" the enron loss will likely be a very sizable one in the surety line , a line that was not particularly effected by the trade center attack , "" cohen said . "" the loss will likely exceed $ 1 billion and we note that the industry wrote surety premiums totaling $ 3 . 5 billion in 2000 . we would expect this loss to have an effect on insurers ' risk appetite pertaining to surety obligations . ""
cohen said chubb likely has reinsurance for its losses and that its gross exposure is "" above the $ 220 million maximum net exposure . ""
ron frank , a salomon smith barney analyst , said , while the enron situation is clearly "" unusual , "" the loss should be viewed relative to chubb ' s overall financial condition , which is quite solid . he said chubb ' s historical profitability in surety is "" very good even including enron . ""
frank noted the chubb announcement didn ' t address any other exposure to enron , such as directors and officers liability . "" management did comment to us that if they saw another exposure material to earnings per share , it would have been released , "" frank said . "" we infer from this that reinsurance and reserves will meaningfully mitigate such exposures . ""
large surety writers include st . paul cos . ( spc ) , american international group ( aig ) , cna financial ( cna ) , act ltd . ( ace ) , safeco corp . ( safc ) and the travelers unit of citigroup inc . ( c ) . however , not all large writers of surety obligations necessarily have an exposure to enron .
at the same time , a major enron loss could inhibit some traditional property - casualty insurers from writing financial guarantee - related risk in the future , said schroeder , the morgan stanley analyst .
schroeder noted that could be a positive for traditional financial guarantors in terms of less competition , but could also be a concern .
for example , ambac financial group inc . ( abk ) and mbia inc . ( mbi ) , both traditional financial guarantors , have been able to "" wrap "" lower levels of risk on certain collateralized debt obligation deals with traditional p & c insurers , while taking the higher , or less risk prone , layers for themselves . being conservative in nature , they might not be willing to take on the more risky layers in the future . - by chad bray , dow jones newswires , 201 - 938 - 5293

usa : enron directors ' side deals raise eyebrows .
11 / 30 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 30 ( reuters ) - directors of enron corp . , already under fire for failing to identify and correct problems that brought the energy trading giant to the brink of collapse , had lucrative side deals with the company that drew added criticism from corporate governance experts on friday .
the deals ranged from consulting jobs to purchases of goods and services from affiliated companies . they raised doubts about the board ' s independence from the senior managers they were supposed to supervise on behalf of the stockholders , the experts said .
"" directors who have side consulting arrangements are not considered , under governance guidelines , to have the necessary independence from management , "" said charles elson , director of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware .
in contrast to the murky off - balance - sheet financing deals that played a key role in enron ' s demise , the company made detailed disclosures of its deals with members of its board of directors in a proxy statement published earlier this year .
the document shows that in addition to his supervisory duties as an enron director , john urquhart was paid $ 493 , 914 last year for providing consulting services to enron .
"" that ' s a huge amount of money . best practice is no consulting fees to any directors , "" said nell minnow , an editor at business research group the corporate library , which does extensive work on corporate governance issues .
another enron director , lord john wakeham , received $ 72 , 000 last year for advice on enron ' s european operations .
enron director herbert winokur was affiliated with the privately owned national tank co . that made sales to enron worth $ 370 , 294 last year , the proxy statement said .
the document also shows that enron paid $ 517 , 200 last year for travel services provided to enron employees . the travel agency business that provided the services is 50 percent - owned by sharon lay , sister of enron chairman and chief executive ken lay .
"" most major companies do not engage in that dodge because it is such an obvious one , "" minnow said .

usa : basic accounting tripped enron , experts say .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - as experts look through the remains of enron corp . for someone to blame , eyes are turning toward the auditors who allowed it to break accounting rules , rather than on the rules themselves .
once the biggest trader in the newly deregulated power market , enron is now near collapse . the auditing profession , which gives financial statements the stamp of approval , needs to be more vigilant to prevent similar future disasters , the experts said .
"" the auditors - the big five auditing firms - have got to look at themselves and say , how can this sort of thing happen ? "" said david hawkins , an accounting consultant with merrill lynch and a professor at harvard university .
"" the rules are there . have we lost our way , so to speak ? do we need a new compass direction ? ""
enron , once a wall street darling with a share price that hit more than $ 90 , started coming apart after it reported losses from transactions that were led by its former chief financial officer and kept off its balance sheet .
experts said it failed to apply generally accepted accounting principles and failed to disclose sufficient information to explain its dealings .
andersen , the accountancy firm that audited enron ' s books , said such judgments are premature .
"" the best idea is to gather information , as the securities and exchange commission and enron board are doing , and then decide what lessons we can learn , "" andersen spokesman david tabolt said . "" instant judgments often are based on presumptions . . . that often turn out later to be incorrect . ""
accounting 101
but the rules that enron appears to have violated are quite straightforward , according to some experts .
for example , recording the note enron received in return for selling equity to its limited partnerships as an asset is contrary to an accounting rule that bans such treatment unless the note is to be paid off in a few days , hawkins said .
ultimately , those transactions turned sour , causing a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and losses that contributed to a $ 1 billion third - quarter charge .
"" this is accounting 101 here , "" said paul brown , chairman of the accounting department at new york university ' s stern school of business . "" it may be that the way it was dressed up was so complicated that it was hard for the auditors to ferret it out but , then again , that ' s their job . ""
the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) , which sets accounting rules , said firms must disclose extensive information about related - party transactions . enron may well have violated the spirit of that law by inadequately explaining its transactions , the experts said .
when enron began to unravel , analysts criticized andersen for failing to explain the firm ' s dealings in its financial statements . enron reported its transactions in cryptic footnotes that many said were almost incomprehensible .
andersen has also come under fire for failing to consolidate those partnerships into enron ' s books , which would have given a truer picture of enron ' s debt .
enron later restated its results to reflect those transactions in its books , cutting earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 , effectively admitting it made a mistake , but not before its credibility had been shattered .
on thursday , harvey pitt , chairman of the sec , which is investigating enron and andersen , said that the agency is looking at whether accounting principles were applied "" appropriately , "" and what may need changing .
patching up loopholes
to be sure , critics have long called for better accounting rules , particularly those regarding the type of off - the - balance - sheet financing that enron engaged in .
tim lucas , who heads a fasb task force on emerging issues , said fasb was trying to complete big projects on business combinations and asset retirement obligations this year , before tackling the issue .
lucas said the enron saga may also hold some implications for rules on financial instruments such as derivatives and recording them at fair value .
"" we will certainly be aware of this ( enron situation ) and if it sheds some light on an area where we can improve the rules we will try and do that , "" he said . "" but it ' s not obvious to me yet that it does . ""
but apart from raising questions about andersen ' s role , the implications of enron ' s near collapse may well force the entire auditing community to do some serious soul searching to prevent future disasters . "" this is a wake up call , "" new york university ' s brown said .

canada : update 1 - enron collapse likely kills planned ontario plant .
11 / 30 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
( recasts with comments from area legislator in paragraph 3 , adds ontario power generation ' s enron exposure paragraph 13 )
toronto , nov 30 ( reuters ) - the collapse of u . s . energy trader enron corp . likely spells the end of plans by its canadian subsidiary to build a c $ 200 million ( $ 130 million ) generating plant in southwestern ontario .
but government officials said on friday that shelving the plant would have little effect on the province ' s plans to open the electricity market to competition next year .
"" enron had an option to purchase a parcel of land in st . clair township to build a peaker plant to generate electricity during peak periods , "" said caroline dicocco , the member of the provincial legislator for sarnia - lampton .
"" the feeling in the community is that this is not going to happen because of severe financial difficulties , "" she said .
enron , north america ' s largest energy trader , now on the verge of collapse , planned through enron canada corp . to build a 400 megawatt generating plant near sarnia , ontario . it recently renewed an option on the land in st . clair township and was seeking various regulatory approvals .
however , enron ' s canadian president rob milnthorp told reuters earlier this year , that the firm had delayed construction of the plant until a clear date was set for the province to open up the market to competition .
the company was not available for comment on friday .
"" we were aware that enron had considered a plant and those plans have been on hold for some time now , "" said mike krizanc , a spokesman for ontario ' s energy ministry .
"" the latest events affecting the company have no impact on what ' s happening in ontario in terms of competition and supply that we ' re anticipating , "" he said .
ontario , canada ' s most populous province and the nation ' s industrial and economic heartland , is set to unveil plans within the next two months for the deregulated power market . the province has already pushed back its original november 2000 deadline by 18 months .
earlier this year , it said it would open the market by may 2002 .
although the planned enron plant will likely never be built , market experts said the company could sell what infrastructure and development it had completed .
"" that is potentially an attractive asset . but any time you ' re selling a half - built house , you know it ' s just not the best way to get value , "" said tom adams , executive director at industry watchdog energy probe in toronto .
meanwhile , ontario power generation , the province ' s biggest electricity producer , said in a release that its exposure to enron was less than c $ 100 , 000 and therefore it "" does not anticipate any adverse earnings impact "" related to its trading activities with the u . s . firm .

s & p : credit derivative exposure to enron is $ 6 . 3 billion
11 / 30 / 2001
pr newswire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire )
new york , nov . 30 / prnewswire / - - standard & poor ' s has reviewed a number of credit derivative transactions in which enron appears and found exposure to the company in three different types of these transactions . divided among these deals , direct enron credit exposure potentially could total $ 3 . 3 billion .
"" although much attention has been focused on enron in relation to loan exposures , the energy sector , and the commodities markets , it is also a named source of credit risk in many credit derivatives transactions , "" said nik khakee , director of standard & poor ' s structured finance derivatives group .
"" in addition , enron had an overall derivatives market strategy that included credit derivatives . thus enron is not only a source of credit risk in derivatives transactions , it is a source of risk to derivatives transactions as it could possibly cause termination events in swaps that enron has contracted , "" mr . khakee continued .
on a global basis , enron appears in 50 transactions as a reference entity or reference obligation in pooled credit derivative transactions , meaning that enron is a credit exposure . two counterparties transact a swap in which the default of enron , as defined by specified credit event language defined in the swap documentation , would lead to potential loss to one counterparty , the floating - rate payer .
this loss is defined by a valuation process whereby a settlement value for the potential enron exposure is determined . this value can often be the result of a bidding process in the market where dealers are solicited . this bidding process is commonly referred to as cash settlement . alternatively , physical settlement may be selected as the settlement mechanism whereby an enron fixed income instrument is exchanged for the notional value of the enron exposure in the overall pool .
these transactions total $ 79 billion in total notional amount . the potential enron exposure in the deals in aggregate totals $ 3 . 3 billion or 0 . 75 % of total notional exposure . it is important to note that these transactions are primarily investment grade credit derivative collateralized debt obligations in which credit support to rated noteholders typically averages 2 % - 4 % . therefore , a default of enron and low recovery on enron post - default would significantly erode this credit support .
"" standard & poor ' s is currently reviewing all transactions in which enron is a named reference entity for possible rating actions , "" mr . khakee said .
enron may also appear in this same type of credit derivative transaction but as part of a small pool , rather than a large pool of overall credit exposure . in this case , enron may potentially be the single reference source of credit risk in a credit derivative transaction , irrespective of the credit risk posed by the actual counterparty risk in these transactions ( which is not addressed in the estimated exposures identified above ) .
enron appears as a reference credit in six transactions with potential total notional exposure to enron of $ 2 . 7 billion in these single - name risk or small basket credit derivative transactions .
in addition , in december 2000 , enron began acting as the counterparty in swap transactions without also being the reference entity . as such , its counterparties are vulnerable to potential default by enron as counterparty , even if it is not a reference source of credit exposure in a transaction .
in these transactions , any default by enron as counterparty under the swap contract would initiate a process whereby termination of the swap contract is possible . the nondefaulting counterparty would have the option to replace enron with a new counterparty in the swaps . this could be done on the whole swap notional amount of credit exposure or the portfolio could be carved up into pieces in order to distribute the risk across various counterparties .
whether transferred to one counterparty or many , this process , called assignment , leads to a mark - to - market valuation . that mark is either in favor of enron or the counterparty enron faces . thus , after an enron default , the counterparty could be exposed to a liquidity risk because it would have to make a mark - to - market payment to enron . conversely , if enron has to make a mark - to market payment to the counterparty , the counterparty may not be receiving the payment , especially if insolvency proceedings commence .
enron has secured ratings on three such credit derivative transactions in which a total notional amount of $ 3 billion of credit derivative exposure was traded .
to give some perspective on this number , mr . khakee explained that standard & poor ' s credit derivatives analysts in new york who review pools of credit exposure have reviewed transactions with a total notional amount of $ 23 billion in the year to date . "" the notional amount of $ 3 billion relative to enron represents a larger percentage of overall rated credit derivative transactions than would be expected of an entity that is not a traditional broker - dealer , investment bank , or insurer , "" he said .

"" maintaining the trust and confidence of investors is a central tenet of our firm , "" said joseph f . berardino , managing partner and chief executive officer . "" we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our auditing tools and skills so that investors can rely on the andersen signature as a sign of quality financial reporting . we are confident that our system of quality is strong . we are pleased with deloitte & touche ' s decision to undertake additional review procedures . ""
the public oversight board ( pob ) is charged with oversight of the accounting profession ' s self - regulatory peer review process in the united states . every three years since 1978 , major accounting firms , under the oversight of the pob , have been engaged to conduct comprehensive reviews of the accounting and audit practices of member firms in the american institute of certified public accountant ' s ( aicpa ) sec practice section ( secps ) .
peer reviews involve an assessment of a firm ' s system of quality control for its accounting and auditing practice under standards established by the secps . this includes , among many other quality measures , an evaluation of a firm ' s audit methodology and tools as well as a review of certain audits in select offices . deloitte & touche ' s work on the 2001 andersen review was nearing completion when enron announced certain financial reporting issues .
the 2001 peer review has been planned and under way for more than eight months . to date , deloitte & touche reviewers and andersen practice review teams have reviewed the system of quality , including audit work , in 30 offices involving more than 40 percent of andersen ' s u . s . audit partners . the reviews conducted by andersen review teams were tested by deloitte & touche , as is customary , and were subject to the oversight of the pob .
"" in light of recent developments , we believe that extending the peer review to include work done in other offices , including houston , and other procedures that deloitte & touche deems appropriate and necessary is the right thing to do , "" said berardino . he noted that andersen was the first major firm to engage another firm to review its system of quality globally - - in 1977 .
andersen is a global leader in professional services . it provides integrated solutions that draw on diverse and deep competencies in assurance , tax , consulting , corporate finance , and in some countries , legal services . andersen employs 85 , 000 people in 84 countries . andersen is frequently rated among the best places to work by leading publications around the world . it is also consistently ranked first in client satisfaction in independent surveys . andersen has enjoyed uninterrupted growth since its founding in 1913 . its 2001 revenues totaled us $ 9 . 3 billion . andersen refers to the brand identity adopted by member firms of the andersen global client service network . learn more at www . andersen . com .

fitch on enron : the coming creditor battle over enron ' s assets
11 / 30 / 2001
business wire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire )
new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 30 , 2001 - - with total assets of $ 62 . 8 billion at sept . 30 , 2001 , enron would become the biggest bankruptcy in united states history if it files for bankruptcy as expected . fitch anticipates a lengthy and contentious battle over enron ' s assets . some of the key issues for creditors are :
what is the enterprise value ?
there are several issues that cloud an enterprise valuation of enron . first and foremost is the uncertain value remaining in enron ' s wholesale trading business . approximately 75 % of enron ' s total 2000 income before interest , minority interests and taxes was generated by the wholesale services segment , which consists primarily of the energy trading business . based on recent refusals of enron ' s energy trading partners to accept the company as a counter - party and exacerbated by implementation of trading restrictions on the company by the new york mercantile exchange , fitch believes significant doubt has been cast upon enron ' s ability to continue to operate this business at its previous scale . further , previous valuations of bankrupt trading businesses have been quite low . therefore , fitch believes it would be prudent to assign a very conservative valuation to this segment in a recovery analysis . secondly , due to the ongoing securities and exchange commission investigation of enron ' s accounting , and previous restatements of earnings , there exists uncertainty over the accuracy of historical earnings reports . finally , enron ' s retail energy segment is closely integrated with the company ' s wholesale operations for energy supply . if the wholesale operations remain shutdown , the future cash flow generation ability of the retail segment may be materially impaired .
how will the value of enron ' s assets be allocated in a bankruptcy ?
fitch has conducted a preliminary analysis of recovery prospects for various creditor classes . enron ' s pipeline business has historically been a steady source of cash flow generation . a market comparable method of valuation for the transportation segment results in strong recovery prospects for secured creditors at northern natural and transwestern . fitch estimates there would be roughly $ 1 billion of residual value from the pipelines following the satisfaction of their secured and unsecured claims and dynegy ' s claim . as part of the merger agreement with enron , dynegy injected $ 1 . 5 billion into enron in exchange for preferred stock in enron ' s largest pipeline , northern natural gas , which can be converted into ownership of the pipeline . dynegy has exercised this option . it is noted that as part of its investment in the preferred stock , dynegy negotiated the right to block a bankruptcy filing at this subsidiary .
enron has various other assets that could be monetized to satisfy unsecured creditor claims . enron has an agreement to sell its portland general electric subsidiary for anticipated net proceeds of about $ 1 . 8 billion in cash or cash equivalents in 2002 . in addition , enron has contracted to sell $ 800 million of merchant assets which is expected to close before year end , subject to execution risks including regulatory and transfer risks . the net proceeds that could be realized from cash on hand , inventories , and various other monetizable assets are difficult to estimate . moreover , the full extent to which the company ' s assets have been pledged is uncertain .
the outstanding amount of senior unsecured debt is currently estimated to be about $ 11 billion , excluding possible liabilities arising from trust structures such as marlin and osprey . additionally , other general unsecured claims in a bankruptcy would include customer deposits , minority interests , project and structured finance make whole obligations , as well as an unknown amount of amount of exposure to is shareholders , employees and others relating to the spate of recent litigation against enron . the amount of these other general unsecured claims can not be determined at this time .
despite the fluidity of the situation , fitch ' s preliminary view is that unsecured creditors would realize recoveries in the 20 - 40 % range . this opinion considers the deterioration in the value of the wholesale trading business , the pledge of flagship assets to secured creditors , the uncertain cashflow generation prospects of the retail segment in light of the wholesale business situation , the opaque and uncertain accounting and off balance sheet liability issues , and other unexpected liabilities .
will enron be able to continue to operate as a going concern or seek to liquidate assets ?
enron would require a sizable debtor in possession facility to fund ongoing operations and induce counter - parties to resume business with enron . fitch believes it is uncertain whether enron has adequate unencumbered or over - collateralized assets to obtain a dip large enough to enable the resumption of wholesale operations .
what is the situation for secured creditors to marlin water trust ii and osprey trust ?
the ratings of marlin ' s $ 915 million senior secured notes and osprey ' s $ 2 . 4 billion senior secured notes rely on support of enron . a liquidation of the underlying assets is the primary source of repayment . a shortfall in liquidation proceeds would become a claim against enron , which may be subject to subordination to the claims of other creditors in a bankruptcy .

new york , nov . 30 / prnewswire / - - standard & poor ' s today placed its triple - ' b ' rating on sutton bridge power ' s ( sbp ) guaranteed gbpl 95 million ( us $ 310 million ) and us $ 150 million secured bonds , issued by sutton bridge power financing ltd . , on creditwatch with negative implications . the creditwatch placement reflects the potential for deterioration in the credit quality of debt - service payments if the existing 25 - year swap with enron corp . is not fundamentally restructured .
the rating action results from the downgrade of enron corp .

"Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )
shirley :
as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .
the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .
and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .
background
the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .
utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .
inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .
for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .
ege objectives
ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .
i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .
ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .
iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .
specific ege concepts
ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .
it produces indicative statistics such as :
a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;
b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;
c . the frequency distribution of load level ;
d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;
e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;
f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;
g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and
h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .
indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .
ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .
ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .
other ege supporting data :
i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;
j . actual maximum generating capacity ;
k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;
l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and
m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .
with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .
the real - world example of allegheny energy
allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .
another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .
offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )
ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .
elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :
1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .
2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .
3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .
4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .
the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .

good morning . unfortunately i ' ll be in milwaukee visiting harley - davidson
about a book revision project both thursday and friday . how about early
next week . i appreciate your patience with me . when you suggested a time
last week i was "" unprepared "" and embarassed to call and expose my
ignorance . since then i have re - read the enron gas services case and have
a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial
sides of the business . the other theme that i have heard many enron
speakers use is the "" de - regulation "" of markets . this certainly played a
factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business .
if you ' ll let me know when it ' s convenient to call next week i ' ll have some
notes put together . i ' m teaching a class for a colleague on monday so
anytime after that is great .
thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip .

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

"Subject: friday p & l
i have just been informed that our p & l was overstated by approx $ 6 million on friday . since it is quarter end , we are re - calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result . the mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month ( may became june , june became july , july became aug , etc . ) .
starting tommorow , harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for east power . the vol curve changes that harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk p & l ( 1 - 2 million ) . most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position , however , the new albany spread option loses a corresponding amount .
the recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the portland risk group being down to 2 people ( total experience of 3 months ) and many of our resources are getting sucked into west issues . continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes .
the $ 23 million of p & l for friday business can be reconciled as follows :
$ 6 million from thursday mistake ( p & l understated on thursday because wednesday curves were used after port calc failed )
$ 10 million in "" true "" friday p & l ( summer 01 , cal 02 & cal 03 all down approx . $ 1 / mwh )
$ 6 million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves .
the final p & l issued by 2 : 00 pm today ( for cob friday ) will be approx . $ 17 million .",0

we have this issue in every deal we do , the benefit coverage is good
overall , but employees pay more for the coverage . it ' s income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits . benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
citigroup and we don ' t want to do anything with subsidy or anything else .

john ,
i am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs . perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem . my
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical / dental premiums .

dealings with a related party have tarnished enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) reputation and crushed its stock , but it looks like that case is far from unique .
the battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities , according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing enron . moreover , enron ' s new cfo , who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related - party dealings of his predecessor , serves on 12 of these entities . and enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a houston - based related entity called es power 3 .
the extent of enron ' s dealings with these companies , or the value of its holdings in them , couldn ' t be immediately determined . but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors ' fears that enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don ' t show up on its balance sheet . if that ' s so , the company ' s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on wall street , where the company was long treated with kid gloves .
enron didn ' t immediately respond to questions seeking details about es power or about the role of the chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , in the various entities . enron ' s board members couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
ten long days
enron ' s previous cfo , andrew fastow , was replaced by mcmahon wednesday after investors criticized fastow ' s role in a partnership called ljm , which had done complex hedging transactions with enron . as details of this deal and two others emerged , enron stock cratered .
the turmoil that resulted in fastow ' s departure began two weeks ago , when enron reported third - quarter earnings that met estimates . however , the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the ljm transactions . since then , investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities . enron stock sank 6 % friday , meaning it has lost 56 % of its value in just two weeks .

however , enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities . the company has said nothing publicly about mcmahon ' s participation in related entities , nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in es power 3 . ( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 .
among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned .
demands , demands
rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .
if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .
friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition .
this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . ""
mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .
under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb

url :
while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .
what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . ""
peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .
the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes .
now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation .
the company ' s challenge
but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .
"" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . ""
dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .
straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .
although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .
the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure .
the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . ""
it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline .
there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . ""
investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer .
first things first
many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .
the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family .
enjoy your weekend with family and friends .
dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default
2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york )
by kristen mcnamara
of dow jones newswires
new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the
organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday .
the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy
services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from new england ' s market .
but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that
triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the
past , the market ' s rulemaker said .
"" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never
been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new
england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s
electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion . ""
news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s
stock and bond prices .
enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem
within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said .
the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market ,
to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said .
"" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said .
the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england
spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its
default .
it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on
occasion , foley and doot said .
"" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact
happened from time to time . ""

enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 47 ( new york )
enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s lawsuit
alleging microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company ' s high - speed
internet service in some u . s . regions .
microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high - speed service in areas where enron
provides broadband access , leaving msn fully operational only in
the 14 states where qwest communications international inc .
operates , said bob visse , director of marketing for msn .
enron ' s lawsuit was filed yesterday . microsoft had planned to
offer fast internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes . microsoft , the no . 2 u . s . internet provider , is
making a push to win customers from aol time warner inc .
` ` we are trying to resolve the issues with enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers , ' ' visse said .
officials at houston - based enron , the largest energy trader ,
did not immediately return calls for comment .
the agreement
enron in june signed an agreement with microsoft to provide
bandwidth for msn internet service . under the agreement , enron
isn ' t required to deliver operational broadband services if
microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system , dow
jones newswire reported .
enron claims in its lawsuit that microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal , dow reported .
enron ' s lawsuit comes after microsoft said in an oct . 23
letter that enron will have breached the contract if it hasn ' t
provided an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , allowing
microsoft to recover damages .
shares of redmond , washington - based microsoft fell 36 cents
to $ 62 . 20 , while enron shares fell 95 cents to $ 15 . 40 .

enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
2001 - 10 - 26 15 : 36 ( new york )
enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - lawyers for a shareholder
suing enron corp . are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold enron assets .
lawyers have made the requests to president greg whalley ,
vice chairman mark frevert and chief financial officer jeff
mcmahon and 83 other employees arrived at enron ' s houston offices
this week , said paul paradis , a partner in the new york law firm
abbey gardy . requests also were sent to 17 enron partnerships such
as whitewing management and marlin water .
paradis represents fred greenberg , an enron shareholder who
is suing the company ' s board for allowing former chief financial
officer andrew fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $ 35 million in cash and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder
equity .
the requests are aimed at determining if enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets . enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies , listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships , according
to texas secretary of state records .
under texas law , failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued . subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don ' t arrive by then , paradis said . enron
spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to requests for comment
about the document requests .
the executives earned no income from the partnerships , enron
spokesman mark palmer has said . ` ` there are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any enron employee , ' ' palmer
said . he said it ' s common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates .
affiliates have debts
texas records show chief executive officer kenneth lay ,
frevert , whalley , mcmahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as enron ' s corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations .
the document requests ask enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates , including stock grants and options . they also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates .
enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural - gas pipelines . that allowed enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books .
the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets
don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has
said .
few answers
investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer
kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call tuesday .
today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to
questions about one of them , es power 3 llc .
texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as
officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire
enron board is also listed .

enron still target in california amid other problems ( updatel )
( updates with closing share price in last paragraph . )
sacramento , california , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in california .
california lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise
prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly .
next month , a california senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento ,
california .
` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i
don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra
montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be
seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said .
the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities
insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market
to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison
international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers .
` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are
putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to
a speedy resolution . ' '
shares of houston - based enron have fallen by more than half
since oct . 16 . the company ousted andrew fastow as the chief
financial officer wednesday amid a u . s . securities and exchange
commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron $ 35
million .
grand jury
enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill
lockyer , who convened a grand jury in june .
lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling
the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron
chairman kenneth lay in ` ` an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says ` hi my name is spike , honey . ' ' ' lockyer
later apologized for the remark .
the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer
spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know
when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power
providers might be filed .
` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we
had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that
slowed things down a bit . ' '
enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney
general ' s investigation .
` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said .
more lawsuits
enron , along with other major power providers such as duke
energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated california energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws .
the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the
city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz
bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer
representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month , he said .
if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including
triple damages .
enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 ,
declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months .

enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 )
( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . )
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low -
interest , short - term loans .
the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents ,
or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today .
chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors
said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets ,
where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer .
` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' '
said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth
third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of
management . ' '
the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark
palmer said .
bonds drop
enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1
1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' '
yield 9 . 53 percent .
investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit
rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses
from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions .
enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart
financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s
investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the
hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital . ' '
though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies
with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for
seven years .
a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value
of enron investors ' stock .
partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron
assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets .
other liabilities
if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money
comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt .
one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would
thin out the holdings of every other investor .
of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have
enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s
lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones
rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' '
one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' '
enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said .
enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on
wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct
losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said .
jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was
named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a
statement .

seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans .
the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events .
on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .

"Subject: california update 6 / 5 / 01
executive summary
? edison ' s mou condemned at this friday ' s cpuc meeting
? the idle plan z
? angelides hides state budget concerns
? house committee to vote on energy relief
edison ' s mou doubtful
the unusually calm settling over the california legislature about socal edison ' s potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders . we have reported that through all plans from b - z , there is not a solid plan to save this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may come to fruition .
over the last few days , edison executives have begun pointing hard at the cpuc meeting this friday as a make - or - break event for the company . the is because after the meeting , davis ' s mou plan to buy socal ' s grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy . this plan is essentially dead although governor daivs has yet to say this in a press releases . the final nail will happen after the cpuc adjourns its friday meeting without voting on several necessary mou provisions . unless the cpuc makes a last minute , emergency - amendment to their agenda , the deal will be dead ( despite socal ' s support for letting the deal stand past its deadline ) . sources indicate that cpuc president loretta lynch holds reservations on the mou and continues to distance herself from davis .
attempting to influence policy making , edison executives have spent the last few investor phone conferences warning that june 8 would see substantially increased risks for a creditor - induced bankruptcy if the davis plan dies at cpuc . this is interesting , since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until edison began mentioning it late last week . however , there is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks . as reported several times earlier , most everyone had given up on the mou long before this friday ' s cpuc meeting .
plan z shows little progress
meanwhile , the unhurried pace toward a plan z that we reported last friday , has gained little progress . legislators continue to pin - point a plan that will secure re - election votes and at the same time , weigh the need for rate hikes for california ' s corporate and home electricity users . as they hash it out , the state is spending even more on electricity purchases . in spite of better than expected levels of conservation , the state ' s electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $ 79 m / day . the recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question the reassuring angelides scenario for california ' s budget prospects later this year .
the california budget crunch
even more worrisome than a idle plan z is increasing evidence that last month ' s conference call with state treasurer angelides was a little misleading . during that conference call angelides claimed that state comptroller connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong . angelides argued that $ 7 . 2 b already spent to buy power since january was really the total amount of authorized spending through late august . in fact , he said only $ 4 . 3 b of that had been "" spent . "" sources now indicate that angelides was technically correct if you use "" spent "" to mean only the amount of money for which checks had been written . this is different than the amount of money california had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supplied energy to the state . in fact , when angelides was speaking the state had in fact already promised to pay $ 7 b for energy it had already consumed ( the total committed has topped $ 8 b . ) by the time the state gets its "" power bonds "" auctioned in august , they will have already spent all $ 12 b and be back to dipping into the general fund . the idea of rans being auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund doesn ' t make it to august .
the nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance . then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid . the only near term path to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3 , 500 mw from qf plants which are off line because of cash flow problems . settling their needs is wrapped up in settling the pg & e and edison trade creditor issues , which makes the legislature ' s leisurely approach to the rate hike / haircut situation all the more troublesome .
energy relief
the house energy & commerce committee is scheduled to vote on h . r . 1647 ( the emergency electricity relief act ) tomorrow at 10 : 00 am . the bill which was twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps , but during the course of the mark - up , sources indicate that it is possible , even likely , that a democrat could offer a price cap amendment . rep . waxman ( d - ca ) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark - up of the bill at the subcommittee level . the waxman amendment was rejected along party lines ( all republicans and 2 democrats voted nay ) . sources inside joe barton ' s office report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on the price cap issue , but nothing has been resolved . as of this afternoon , those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the committee tomorrow . since an agreement was not reached , compromise language is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow . if it is , it would not be something that leaders on the republican and democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass . sources indicate that the committee does expect waxman , and possibly others to offer price cap language , but it is not expected to pass .",0

i was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis
the first of the preprints that i recently authored on my model for spikes in
power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power . in this
regard , i have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the
center for energy finance education and research and the institute for
computational finance at the ut austin . right now i am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint . please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint .
i look forward to hearing from you .
sincerely yours ,
valery kholodnyi

txu energy trading
ps . here are the main preprints that i have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power :
1 . valery a . kholodnyi , the stochastic process for power prices with spikes
and
valuation of european contingent claims on power , preprint , txu - rag - 01 / 00 ,
july
2000 .
2 . valery a . khlolodnyi , valuation of a swing option on power with spikes ,
preprint txu - rag - 05 / 00 , august , 2000 .
3 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a spark spread option on power with
spikes ,
preprint txu - rag - 21 / 00 , november 2000 .
4 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of european contingent claims on power at
two
distinct points on the grid with spikes in both power prices , preprint
txu - rag - 24 / 00 , november 2000 .
5 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a transmission option on power with
spikes ,
preprint txu - rag - 25 / 00 , november 2000 .
as i have indicated to you in my previous e - mail , contrary to the standard
approaches , i model spikes directly , as self - reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes . in this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non - markovian
process , even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
markovian . among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes , provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes .",0

i based the code of conduct on what sam behrends had drafted for
the netco mbr application ; as you suggest , it may be preferable to
use the code that epmi or pge uses . one other thing that we still
need to focus on is the undertaking in footnote 17 of the february
1 draft concerning standards of conduct for the pipelines , or at
least transwestern . .

looks good . i need to find a different version of code of conduct
that
more closely mimics epmi and pge version . the agreement in
appendix b
right now may be too restrictive for our current dealings .
agree that we need to finish up details of ( a ) data transfer and
( b )
transistional services agreement .
in my discussions on friday , the transitional services will be
"" agent "" type
activities . enron needs help in making sure that it can service
its
contracts . no ubs warburg energy employee will make commercial
decisions
for enron - simply perform directed activities .
the question of data transferred is still outstanding , but i will
hopefully
know more on monday am . i am checking on exactly how much
counterparty
info will be held by ubs warburg energy .
i plan on being in your office first thing tues am .
thanks ,
jim

here is what i had come up with . my thought is that the bold
roman
numeral headings would make up an agenda , which we should send
to
cindy marlette on monday , along with a list of those who will
attend for ubs . the subheadings , which would not appear on the
what we send to ferc , would be the main items for discussion .
i don ' t think your approach and mine are very far apart . i
might
be somewhat less affirmative about raising the section 203
issue .
it will surely come up as we describe what will or will not be
transferred .
i also think it would be very helpful to clear up the points
about
the approach to existing enron customers , and the transitional
arrangements before the meeting i would like , in any event , to
put something into the mbr application on transition
arrangements
that is more definitive - - in the right way - - than footnote 12 of
the
draft i sent out yesterday .

hi sally ,
i need to be working on my newest project , for which we went to hallettsville
this week , and tomorrow is garden club , and i am almost through as president .
i will not preside in april , as i have a conflict - new secretary in colonial
dames and then all we have left in garden club will be our may luncheon .
being presdent has not been too bad , as all of the ladies are very helpful .
my project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our
cemetery by the state historic commissson . that is why we were in
hallettville . hope to get that done by tuesday - there are many attachments
necessary . we stayed in a bed and breakfast , which was fair but not
oustanding breakfast . i ran by to see dot for a few minutes before we headed
home . mary had spent sunday night with us to go with us and we met our

enough of that , this will be a great quick way to communicate . i am glad
cindy gave me your address . hope you have had a great week - end . i will
write more another time .

"Subject: travel services
while recent events have dramatically impacted enron ' s travel volume ,
alliance worldwide ( formerly travel agency in the park ) wanted to contact
you regarding the enron travel program . since 1984 , our company has been a
strategic business partner with enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking , ticketing , ticket delivery , customer service ,
reporting , management of clicktrip , to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit enron . these services have been
provided on a management fee basis from alliance to enron . as of december
1 , 2001 the management fee has been suspended during enron ' s period of
reorganization . we are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket .
to provide you with a brief history of our arrangement , enron and alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for enron ' s business travel . these discounts are available only
through alliance and are given at time of ticketing . all commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to enron , in
exchange for enron paying alliance a contracted management fee . this
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions . this travel program provided
enron over $ 8 . 6 million in airline savings on $ 55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $ 5 . 2 million on $ 33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001 . these savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee .
the effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined . we have contacted the airline
companies and most of enron ' s preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through april 2002 . you may utilize these discounts through
alliance by calling 713 650 - 8080 or 1 800 962 - 0248 . in march , enron and
alliance will begin evaluating enron ' s volume and travel patterns , and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure .
as mentioned earlier , alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee . these fees are reimbursable to enron employees
through normal expense report procedures . specifically , the new fee
structure is based on zero - commission contracts for tickets purchased from
enron ' s preferred carriers . the fee schedule for all airline tickets for
enron travel is as follows :
$ 30 - domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$ 30 - international tickets without upfront discount
25 % of savings , capped at $ 175 - international tickets with upfront discount
$ 15 - southwest airlines and clicktrip reservations , hotel / car only bookings
the savings to enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged . for example , enron ' s average ticket prices are $ 589
domestic and $ 2207 international ( after discounts ) . enron ' s average savings
are $ 144 domestic and $ 587 international ( before fees ) . the savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee !
if you are accustomed to booking your own travel online , you may continue to
do so by booking through clicktrip . clicktrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to enron ' s negotiated discounts . ticketing through
clicktrip also bears a smaller fee of $ 15 if no agent assistance is
necessary . there is no charge to look at schedules . clicktrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through enron ' s intranet site
or via the internet site
. clicktrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status . to check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary , simply click the check my trip
button on the clicktrip home page and fill in your name and amadeus locator
number ( provided at the top of your itinerary ) . a user log - in may be
obtained by contacting alliance at 713 328 - 5100 .
if your office location , phone number or any profile information has
changed , please notify us by return email . a profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to alliance at 713 328 - 5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile .
we at alliance are proud of our 17 year association with enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs . we have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on enron ' s account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come .
if you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned , or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies , please
call me 713 328 - 5139 , or email lhinson @ allianceworldwide . com

you may need to load the borland bde v 5 . 0 software to use this , if not

we enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool .
if deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
unify .
if the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group .
you can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit .
the date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal .
start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal .
sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id .
indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal .
if you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
( awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal ) . if you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks .
you can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar .
we did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons :
- the expense to build the filter .
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing .
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it .
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
state - once petro can / suncor / sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column .

greg has asked if i would help arrange 1 hour individual meetings with the otc of each ews bu to discuss the relative performance of each of your commercial md ' s and vp ' s so far this year . the intent is to give greg a general understanding of how you would rate your md and vp slates on a continuum of top through bottom ( i . e . ignoring the prc 1 thru 5 scale but instead listing number 1 thru number 10 if you have 10 vp ' s ) .
in recognising that this may seem like an additional burden over and above the various prc discussion we have already committed to , i would encourage you to avoid spending any significant time in preparing for this discussion , aside from ensuring you have a complete picture of all your commercial vp ' s and md ' s and then listing them down quickly as above .

subject : re : coal deals
the bengalla deal was struck after i had given ecap notice of the liquidity problems , and more importantly , without any rac involvement .
from a rac perspective this deal is still unapproved . if an invoice discount facility can be used , or some other means of performing without using enron capital then you should move forward . if these options are not available , then the issue should either be raised to louise kitchen for approval or unwound until the liquidity problems are resolved .

i assume this does not apply to ectrl business , as we have not been given a reciprocal recommendation for european biz . can you confirm this ? also , can you clarify what the specific issue is with ecap that is not an issue with ectrl ? is this specific to cash flow within australian entities ?

in light of the current situation in houston , i recommend we wait to finalize any physical coal sourcing or deliveries in the ecap business . in short , rac cannot approve any purchase or sale until the liquidity issues are resolved . hopefully by the end of the week we will know more , have things settled , and business can continue as normal .
please call me if you have any questions .

"Subject: re : bridgeline cash and ar
to all :
last night i spoke with trevor milhalik about the cash distribution which would normally occur at the end of the year . the most viable and quickest way to get the cash we felt was to increase the revolver from $ 35 mm to $ 70 mm because , as stated below , there exists significant current capital needs to fill the enron # 1 storage cavern . however , even still , this would only ensure a cash distribution at the end of december - the normal schedule for the partnership .
there may be one more possiblity . we could reapproach the board about the prior structure of levering up bridgeline in order to extract cash from the joint venture - it failed last year because texaco did not want the cash . it may different now that chevron is involved , but i doubt it . my guess is that senior management ( i . e . louise ) would have to put pressure on the appropriate channels . i would rather pay a "" premium "" to chevron / texaco for levering bridgeline than entering in a series of park - and - lend arrangements because we could get more cash up front . in addition , any park - and - lend arrangements could have negative earnings impacts contingent upon the shape of the nymex .

subject : re : bridgeline cash and ar
to all :
as of today , bridgeline has $ 14 mm of cash and expects to get $ 15 mm from the payment of oct receivables by the end of the month . they have fully drawn down the $ 35 mm revolver that we put in place earlier this year . trevor mihalik ( bridgeline cfo ) is preparing a cashflow forecast for bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year .
bridgeline ' s major cash needs are to fund working capital ( payables and margin calls ) and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern ( enron # 1 ) that we contributed to the partnership . the dewatering process is now underway and will be completed mid - march 2002 . at a gas price of $ 2 . 50 and , working gas volume of 6 bcf , the total cash need for working gas will be approx . $ 15 mm .
we are working with bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make ( and accelerate ) the 2001 cash distribution to the partners . alternatives we are considering to fund the working gas : ( i ) increase the revolver from $ 35 mm to $ 70 mm , ( ii ) find third parties ( enron ? ) to enter into park - and - lend arrangements that would give bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it . most options will require chevron / texaco approval , which may come at a price .
i will distribute the cash flow statement when i receive it and jean and i will meet with randy and trevor next week to discuss alternative financing / park - and - lend arrangements . i have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together the 2002 plan ( budget , headcount , capital needs , insurance requirements , etc . ) . we should adhere to this commercial context so that we don ' t provide leverage to bridgeline and chevron / texaco in any commercial discussions . i will admit , however , given the headlines , it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash .

brian

jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue . under australian law the directors of ecappl need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid . failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt . if the coal group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments then that is the obvious way forward . one of the coal group in the sydney office ( presumably paul mcphee ) could replace heidi mason as resident director .

we seem to be going round in circle ' s here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e - mail so we can resolve swiftly . this cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port . it is coal which will be shipped to service european commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account ( including financing ) . needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world . last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these european sales at what is likely to be a higher price .
appreciate the green light .

it has been made clear to me that jeff shankman needs to clear this transaction through bill bradford and louise kitchen prior to any capital going out the door . it is my understanding that this has not been done .

stu ,
i refer to your e - mail to jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc .
vessel name : mv "" cotsworld ""
eta : 21 / nov
ets : 22 / nov
loading tonnage : approx . 128 kmt ( 9 kmt from stratford and 119 kmt from bengalla )
payment value and timing :
value timing
bengalla : us $ 3 . 3 mil ( * ) 19 th ( * * )
stratford : us $ 0 . 2 mil ( * ) 26 th
* inclusive of 10 % gst
* * bengall has already delivered 49 kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15 th .
the contract is based on fis and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des / dem risk .
because of their concern over our credit bengalla has insisted on our payment by tt against the presentation of documents . docs are likely to be
presented on 16 th or 19 th at the latest .
the draft contract which bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on b / l quantity instead of inbound rail weight
if we take 100 % of bengalla coal onto our vessel . if we do that , they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26 th instead .

good to hear from you and i ' m glad you ' re available . how is wednesday at
2 : 30 ?
i did look at eol and am not surprised to see its quality . i was unable to
say much about it in my risk electricity hedging and trading report because
of deadline pressures . how is the site doing ? i am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that goldman ,

about a shotgun marriage !
if we have time next week , i could step you through our website - -
www . weathereffects . com . i ' m very proud of what we ' ve done . i can ' t give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password . it ' s a very ambitious site - - with state - of - the - art
wsi weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for
pjm and nepool . esai contributes oil and gas input price forecasts , capacity
judgments , and "" herding "" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods . after one month ' s full - bore effort , i ' m pleased with the
results ( e . g . , we forecast nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ) .
have a great weekend .

"Subject: senate switch affects energy bill outlook
at lpm houston time today , senator james jeffords ( r - vt ) will announce that he is switching from the republican party to become an independent voting with the democrats . if this happens , control of the senate will switch to the democrats , which will give the dems a majority and control of the senate .
? all committee chairs would become democratic and the dems would control the legislative agenda
( energy bills , california bailout , possible investigation of who influenced the cheney plan etc . ) . in a profound ideological shift , sen . murkowski ( r - ak ) would be replaced by sen . bingaman ( d - nm ) as chair of the senate energy committee . when bingaman takes over the senate energy committee , expect pipeline safety issues to again come to the fore . bingaman is a strong proponent of tough pipeline safety regulation ( particularly in the wake of the carlsbad explosion last year ) and will likely insist on strict safety requirements in the cheney energy bill .
? the recommendations for loosening regulations for oil / gas drilling , coal and power as well as incentives for new generation contained in the cheney bill are likely to be heavily revised in favor of more conservation - oriented measures .
? the tax bill will likely be downsized , particularly if jeffords makes his switch immediately . the timing is important because the senate - house conference on the bill must be appointed immediately .
? all presidential appointments would be controlled by the dems . this is significant because of the large number of sub - cabinet level appointments that need to be approved .
at the same time , republicans are trying to convince sen . zell miller ( d - ga ) , who already votes republican , to switch to the republican party . if this happens , it will cancel out the expected jeffords move . initial reports are that miller will not switch .
one other caveat - - jeffords has pondered a switch in the past and then flaked out . but if jeffords goes through with it and miller stays put , the balance of power in washington will be tipped in favor of the democrats .",0

hi zimin ,
inflation :
i am also spending a lot of time looking at short - term auto - regressive models
for ppi and long - term , more fundamentally - based models . this work is
important because we have potentially a large positive p & l that may be
unlocked by moving to our new indicative uk ppi curves . john sherriff and
trena are keen that any models i produce are vetted / approved in houston , so i
will forward to stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and
documented .
storage :
thanks for the current storage model . due to the complexity of the
modelling issues involved , i would strongly support a visit by you to help me
meet the needs of the london customers in this matter , and am happy to act as

of dow jones newswires
washington - ( dow jones ) - members of the pacific northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the u . s . federal energy regulatory commission ' s mandate for consolidation of power - grid assets in the region .
the house northwest energy caucus held an informal hearing late wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about ferc ' s effort to establish a regional transmission organization , or rto .
the lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to ferc voicing the concerns , which largely revolve around skepticism that the rto will result in cost savings for the region ' s consumers .
ferc shouldn ' t force an rto on the region without first conducting a cost - benefit analysis , said rep . peter defazio , d - ore . , who is spearheading the effort .
speaking with reporters prior to wednesday ' s hearing , defazio complained that "" a bunch of bureaucrats "" at ferc are embracing the national power - grid agenda of enron corp . ( ene ) without assessing the costs and regardless of "" what it does for local reliability . ""
defazio ' s complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at wednesday ' s hearing .",0

enron cuts shareholder equity by 1 . 2 bln usd due to partnership deal
10 / 18 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
london ( afx ) - enron corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1 . 2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , the wall street journal reported in its online edition .
enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on tuesday , when the houston - based energy giant announced a 1 . 01 bln usd charge to third - quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss .
however , the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday . as a result of the reduction , enron ' s shareholder equity dropped to 9 . 5 bln usd , the company said .
in an interview , enron chairman kenneth lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1 . 01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with ljm 2 co - investment lp , a limited partnership created and run by fastow .
in a conference call yesterday with investors , lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by enron , as the company "" unwound "" its participation in the transactions . in the third quarter , the company ' s average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln .
according to rick causey , enron ' s chief accounting officer , these shares were contributed to a "" structured finance vehicle "" set up about two years ago in which enron and ljm 2 were the only investors . in exchange for the stock , the entity provided enron with a note .
the aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of enron ' s broadband telecommunications and other technology investments . causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took .
subsequently , both the value of enron ' s stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply , the report said . as a result , enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares . when enron reacquired the shares , it also canceled the note it had received from the entity .
given all the complexities of the ljm - related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company , "" the confusion factor wasn ' t worth the trouble of trying to continue this , "" causey said .
mark palmer , an enron spokesman , described the capital reduction "" as just a balance - sheet issue "" and therefore was not deemed "" material "" for disclosure purposes .

10 / 18 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , oct 18 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock fell sharply on thursday as investors digested news of a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the energy giant ' s shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week .
in afternoon trading enron ' s stock was off $ 2 . 96 or , 9 . 2 percent at $ 29 . 24 per share .
enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on tuesday after taking charges of $ 1 . 01 billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations .
the reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company ' s earnings statement but was discussed by chairman and chief executive ken lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on tuesday .
"" confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure . this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much , "" said one analyst who asked not to be identified .
the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday , bringing it to the attention of a wider audience , analysts said .
lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts .
as a result of the operation , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent , but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year , lay said .
moody ' s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several enron businesses .
some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings .

brazil ' s copene , elektro plan to sell 820 mln reais of bonds
2001 - 10 - 18 13 : 53 ( new york )
rio de janeiro , oct . 18 ( bloomberg ) - - two brazilian
companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell
820 million reais ( $ 279 million ) of bonds , raising the amount of
pending local market bond sales to 7 . 5 billion reais .
brazil ' s copene - petroquemica do nordeste sa , a petrochemical
company , has asked brazil ' s government for permission to sell 625
million reais of bonds according to the country ' s security and
exchange regulator , the cvm . banco citibank sa , the brazilian unit
of citigroup inc . , will manage the sale .
elektro eletricidade e servicos sa , an electricity utility
controlled by u . s . - based enron corp . that distributes electricity
in sao paulo state , has asked for permission to sell 195 million
reais of bonds , according to a cvm filing .
no further details about the sales was immediately available .
brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as
the local currency , the real , plunges against the dollar , making
dollar - denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as
the local currency value of dollar debts soars .
so far this year , about 9 . 1 billion reais of local market
debt has been sold . meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or
dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $ 1 . 7 billion in the
third quarter from $ 4 . 5 billion in the second , not including sales
through offshore subsidiaries , according to bloomberg data .",0

the bond legislation
the democrats in the assembly and sentate have agreed to language to create a dedicated rate component to repay the budget and de - link the bonds from the dwr contracts .
but the republicans have still not agreed to go along .
the bill would require a 2 / 3 ' s vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule , so republican votes are necessary .
the republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along .
the conference committee
senator burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core / noncore proposal .
using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure , but how much longer is uncertain .
no sense yet of when hearings on the core / noncore proposal - - - in conference committee or otherwise - - will take place , though burton continues to say that he wants to "" give it a chance . ""
the core / noncore legislative language
the negotiating group continues to work on the language .
the language was supposed to be delivered to hertzberg by cob today , but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning .
senator dunn ' s investigative committee hearing
the hearing ' s been moved from tomorrow to wednesday .

enron , the largest electricity and natural gas trader in north america , also on monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks .
enron shares were down $ 1 . 40 , or 9 . 03 percent , to $ 14 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after earlier in the session trading below $ 14 for the first time since december 1994 .
moody ' s also warned that it could cut the debt rating again , now downgraded to baa 2 , as well as its rating for the enron ' s commercial paper .
enron ' s credit - worthiness will have a direct affect on its day - to - day trading operations and its trading partners ' perception of making good on trades . with a credit rating hovering above junk status , the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades .
last week enron shares lost almost $ 14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company ' s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out .
investors have fled enron ' s stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off - the - balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow in deals the u . s . securities and exchange commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest .
enron compensated its partners in this off - balance sheet structure with the promise of enron shares , if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level .
many industry observers see enron ' s request for additional credit , after the company tapped its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week , as a sign a weakness .
"" we are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one ' s backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength , but instead . . . it ' s an act of desperation , "" said carol levenson , an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit . com .

usa : us companies ' credit quality to worsen - moody ' s .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better , a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on monday .
moody ' s investors service said that in the third quarter , it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 u . s . companies . at the same time , it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies .
that 5 . 5 - to - 1 ratio is far greater than the 1 . 3 - to - 1 ratio in the second quarter .
in dollar terms , the situation looks more dire . moody ' s warned it may downgrade $ 543 billion of debt , dwarfing the $ 66 billion moody ' s said it may upgrade by 8 . 2 - to - 1 .
"" particularly in light of september 11 , the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . "" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year . ""
rating reviews are significant because , unlike actual rating changes , they are not a "" lagging "" indicator , and suggest the future direction of corporate credit . moody ' s normally wraps up its reviews within three months .
u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening u . s . economy , an inability of marginal companies to raise cash , debt - financed merger activity and fallout from the sept . 11 attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance , and travel .
for example , moody ' s in july warned it may cut comcast corp . ' s ratings after the philadelphia - based company bid $ 44 . 5 billion for at & t corp . ' s cable tv operations .
then last month , moody ' s warned it may cut chicago - based boeing co . ' s ratings because of the attacks ' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes .
in the third quarter , moody ' s warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative - grade , or "" junk "" - rated , companies , and raise the ratings of just 11 . for investment - grade companies , the gap was even more yawning : 68 - to - 11 .
and in the fourth quarter ? through friday , moody ' s warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four . on monday , it downgraded embattled energy trading giant enron corp . , and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade .
puchalla , however , said the decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively .
"" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said . "" that is a positive for credit quality . ""
the third quarter was the 14 th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades . the record is 19 quarters , set between 1988 and 1993 .

enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel )

enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel )
( updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph . )
houston , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which can ' t get
low - interest , short - term loans , faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank , credit analysts said .
` ` anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous , ' ' said
sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . ` ` it ' s
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral . ' '
enron is trying to get $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in loans from
citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company ' s stock since
oct . 17 , the wall street journal reported . the company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners .
the company on thursday tapped $ 3 . 3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $ 2 billion in commercial paper ,
or short - term corporate loans . a week ago , the enron said the u . s .
securities and exchange commission had began an inquiry into
related - party transactions . they cost the company $ 35 million and
$ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity .
` ` banks are in the driver ' s seat , and enron is a little
desperate , ' ' said peter petas , a debt analyst at creditsights inc .
` ` i think their interest rates for loans would go up . ' '
sells assets for cash
companies in enron ' s situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans , petas said . those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral .
enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash . two related
partnerships , osprey and marlin , depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $ 3 . 3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants . enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds .
the company plans to complete the $ 2 . 9 billion sale of
portland general electric , an oregon utility , to northwest natural
gas co . next year .
shares of houston - based enron fell $ 1 . 30 , or 8 . 4 percent , to
$ 14 . 10 in midday trading . earlier , they touched $ 13 . 55 , down 12
percent . the company ' s credit rating was cut by moody ' s investors
service after it wrote down the value of its assets .
the stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months .

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - enron shares slipped to a new six - year low in early trade as north america ' s largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks .
enron ' s shares were trading down 90 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 14 . 60 in early morning trade on the new york stock exchange . shares crashed through $ 15 , a low not seen since february 1995 .
last week , enron shed almost $ 14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week , when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out .
however , many industry observers see enron ' s request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength .

enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line , which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line .

enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first - quarterly loss in more than four years on oct . 16 . the company also wrote down $ 1 . 2 billion in equity , including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from enron last week .

power points : enron may have to rethink asset - light focus
by mark golden

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - on the face of things , it ' s hard to understand the stock market ' s headspinning reaction to enron corp . ' s ( ene ) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks .
why the talk of a "" death spiral "" for north america ' s premier energy trading company ? the stock price of cisco systems inc . ( csco ) , for example , saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12 - month period . nobody questioned the viability of cisco .
the difference is that over the past few years , enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question .
if you ' re buying network components , you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier . after all , you ' re buying something you can touch . but if you ' re buying power or gas , what you ' re really buying is a commitment to deliver . if your supplier doesn ' t come through when the market gets tough , you ' re left totally exposed . in enron ' s energy trading business , then , credibility at every level is critical .
for now , enron looks to be more than viable . but the company ' s asset - light strategy might not be . gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1 . 65 % in the third quarter from 5 . 26 % in the first quarter of 1998 . meanwhile , asset - heavy energy companies like mirant corp . ( mir ) and calpine corp . ( cpn ) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure .
two weeks ago , enron reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , resulting from $ 1 . 01 billion in write - offs . that didn ' t send investors running , however . in fact , its stock price rose a bit on the news .
what hurt was the disclosure that enron had reduced its net assets , or "" shareholders ' equity , "" by $ 1 . 2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . that , along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the securities 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com

official correction enron long - term ratings downgraded to baa 2 - moody ' s

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
( moody ' s corrected its stance on enron ratings to a downgrade )
new york ( afx ) - moody ' s investors service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long - term debt ratings of enron corp from baal to baa 2 following a deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments .
the long - term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade , moody ' s said .
moody ' s also placed the company ' s prime - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade .
moody ' s initially placed enron ' s long - term debt ratings on review on oct 16 . the write - downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of enron ' s share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper , according to moody ' s .
in response to these events , moody ' s said enron has shored up its near - term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper , leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1 . 2 bln usd .
moody ' s said it plans to focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties .

uk : europe energy firms wary of enron on credit worries .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , oct 29 ( reuters ) - energy companies in europe are shying away from trading with troubled u . s . energy group enron amid concerns about the company ' s credit status , industry sources said on monday .
several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with enron - one of europe ' s biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the u . s . group about setting up new credit arrangements , the sources said .
"" i think enron ' s approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow , "" said the head of risk management at one uk utility that halted its trade with enron last week .
"" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" he said . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . ""
a spokesman for enron ' s european headquarters in london headquarters declined to comment .
reluctance to trade with enron in europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five - year lows .
triggering the slide was news last week the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer .
houston - based enron trades a large amount of its volume in the u . s . and europe through its internet enrononline system .
last friday the company said trade on enrononline was above average levels with more than 8 , 400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $ 4 billion .
traders said enron ' s plight could hit liquidity in european gas and power markets , where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years .
one industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the uk electricity market had put on hold their trading enron , which is among the biggest five traders in the market .
in mainland europe , where enron has been a major driver of liquidity , potential counterparties are treading with care .
"" we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , "" said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named .
french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning .
"" enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem , "" said one french trader .

bandwidth beat : enron puts spotlight back on broadband

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
a dow jones newswires column
houston - ( dow jones ) - thanks to enron corp . ( ene ) , the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money .
but it won ' t be traders who will cash in on this new potential . it will be class - action attorneys . they ' re already lining up to sue enron in at least five shareholder suits .
as of oct . 25 , two of lawsuits had been filed against enron in federal court and three more in texas state court . most of them name as defendants ken lay , enron ' s longtime chairman , former chief executive jeff skilling and andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence oct . 25 .
still another suit , which isn ' t a class action suit , was filed naming as defendants members of enron ' s board of directors .
all the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships enron set up , many of them managed by fastow . most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with enron .
the transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband , water and other enron investments .
fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions . as enron ' s chief financial officer , he was being paid to manage the corporation ' s finances . as general partner of two ljm partnerships , he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with enron . he shared in profits of those partnerships .
when investors began demanding information about the transactions , enron ' s share price began to slide . with the heat on , enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $ 544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals , among other things .
that ' s when the class action attorneys went to work . so far , at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs . enron didn ' t respond to calls asking about the lawsuits .
among the law firms representing plaintiffs is milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach , which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit . the release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $ 30 billion from class action lawsuits .
the lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market . some of the deals with the ljm partnerships run by fastow "" purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market , "" according to abrams and franks v . enron et al .
that could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months . market skeptics have said enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth .
enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties , a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year , according to enron .
now market watchers will want to know if any of enron ' s trades were done with the ljm partnerships managed by fastow .
they will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with chewco investments . that houston company , according to a report in the wall street journal , was managed by michael kopper and was set up in 1997 when kopper was a managing director with enron ' s global equity markets group . he left enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by fastow .
do the plaintiffs ' attorneys know whether enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships ?

enron replaces andrew fastow as cfo amid sec inquiry ( updatel )
( adds statement from enron ' s kenneth lay in second
paragraph . )
houston , oct . 24 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ousted chief
financial officer andrew fastow amid a securities and exchange
commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest
energy trader $ 35 million .
enron named jeff mcmahon , head of its industrial markets
group , as cfo because ` ` it became clear to me that restoring
investor confidence would require us to replace andy , ' ' chairman
and chief executive officer kenneth lay said in a statement .
fastow will take a leave of absence .
shares of enron , based in houston , fell as much as 22 percent
today after analysts downgraded the stock . the company said on
monday that the sec had begun an inquiry into partnerships fastow
ran .
enron fell $ 3 . 38 , or 17 percent , to $ 16 . 41 , the sixth
straight day of decline . earlier , the shares touched $ 15 . 51 , their
lowest since february 1995 . the stock plunged 21 percent on
monday , after enron disclosed that the sec had requested
information on the partnerships .
the stock fell after lay failed to ease concerns about the
sec inquiry or enron ' s financial reporting in a conference call
yesterday . investors have criticized lay for not disclosing enough
about the workings of investment vehicles such as fastow ' s
partnerships . the stock has fallen 57 percent since oct . 11 ,
losing more than $ 15 billion in market value .

enron shares drop for sixth day on stock downgrades ( update 5 )
( updates with closing share price and fastow on leave of
absence in second paragraph . )
houston , oct . 24 ( bloomberg ) - - shares of enron corp . fell 17
percent after several analysts downgraded the stock and the u . s .
securities and exchange commission began an inquiry into
partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron fell $ 3 . 38 to $ 17 . 08 , dropping for the sixth day in a
row . it was the biggest percentage decline among stocks in the
standard & poor ' s 500 index . earlier , the stock touched $ 15 . 51 ,
the lowest since february 1995 . after the close of regular u . s .
trading , enron said fastow will take a leave of absence , and jeff
mcmahon was named chief financial officer .
chief executive officer kenneth lay failed to ease concerns
about the sec inquiry or enron ' s financial reporting in a
conference call yesterday . investors have criticized lay for not
revealing enough about the workings of investment vehicles such as
fastow ' s partnerships . the stock has fallen 57 percent since oct .
11 , losing more than $ 15 billion in market value .
` ` enron ' s conference call began as a methodical review of
current liquidity and deteriorated into an inadequate defense of
the balance sheet , ' ' lehman brothers analyst richard gross wrote
in a report . he left his ` ` strong buy ' ' rating unchanged .
other analysts lowered their ratings , including carol coale
at prudential securities who downgraded enron to ` ` sell ' ' from
` ` hold . ' ' anatol feygin of j . p . morgan dropped his rating to long -
term ` ` buy ' ' from ` ` buy . ' ' first albany corp . ' s robert christensen
downgraded the stock to ` ` buy ' ' from ` ` strong buy . ' '
possible downgrade
moody ' s investors service last week placed all $ 13 billion of
the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade . a reduction in the rating could cut houston - based enron
off from the commercial paper market , raising the costs of short -
term debt .
enron said earlier this month that dealings with the fastow
partnerships contributed to $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses .
enron has at least 18 such partnerships , which were created to
move debt off its books and lower its tax liabilities as well as
dispose of assets .
an investor has sued enron saying that fastow ' s leadership of
the partnerships , as well as membership on their boards by other
enron executives , is a conflict of interest . the company has $ 3 . 3
billion in potential liabilities attached to such investment
vehicles , the wall street journal reported today .
` ` i don ' t know that we were aware of everything going on with
enron , ' ' said jim walline , manager of the lutheran brotherhood
fund , which owned 93 , 060 shares on sept . 1 . ` ` we had a lot of
confidence and clearly that has been busted a little . ' '

stockwatch enron falls 20 pct on worries deals with ljm will impact earnings
10 / 24 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - shares of enron corp were sharply lower in afternoon trade , falling over 20 pct , as investors sold the stock a third day running on concerns that financial transactions made with related party ljm could negatively impact future earnings , dealers said .
at 2 . 15 pm , enron was down 4 . 06 usd , or 20 . 52 pct , at 15 . 73 .
the djia was up 9 . 76 points at 9 , 349 . 77 , and the s & p 500 composite index was up 0 . 92 at 1 , 085 . 70 , while the nasdaq composite fell 22 . 42 to 1 , 726 . 96 .
the company confirmed yesterday that the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions .
many analysts responded by cutting the shares ratings on concerns that dealings with the related ljm partnership could affect future earnings , after two class actions were filed against the company yesterday .
the two lawsuits claim that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not credit worthy .
the company ' s operating results were also "" materially overstated as result of the company failure to timely write down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships "" managed by the company ' s cfo .
the suit additionally alleged that enron failed to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap ( generally accepted accounting principles ) .
in its third - quarter results last week , enron announced a charge of 1 . 01 bln usd , or 1 . 11 usd per share , and an incremental 1 . 2 bln usd reduction in stockholders ' equity , related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships .
jp morgan analyst anatol feygin said he has downgraded the stock to a ' long - term buy ' from a ' buy ' in "" the wake of lingering concerns regarding the company ' s credit situation and management disclosure of liabilities stemming from off - balance sheet financing vehicles . ""
the stock has been removed from jp morgan ' s "" focus list "" .
feygin also said that "" management ' s conference call yesterday morning was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns . ""
goldman sachs analyst , david fleischer also agreed that enron ' s disclosure was "" modest "" and "" management did not resolve concerns . ""
however , credit concerns and questions about potential liabilities are "" very much exaggerated , "" he said
"" the real issue will turn out to be huge debt that enron was placing in these entities . ""
the shares ' value have fallen by more than 40 pct since enron reported charges related to investments with ljm last week , but fleischer said he sees no recovery until management fully answers investor questions and restores credibility , an outcome he expects in future weeks .

new york , oct 24 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . plunged further in midday trade on wednesday , hugging the top spot on the list of biggest losers on the new york stock exchange , on concerns whether financial deals made by north america ' s largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect earnings going ahead .
shares were trading down 20 . 87 percent , or $ 4 . 13 , to $ 15 . 66 in midday trade , capping over a 75 percent decline this year in share price . as of tuesday , the company has lost more than $ 10 billion in value in the past week .
some analysts cut ratings or expressed concerns about the former high flyer ' s lack of forthrightness in discussing business deals , unimpressed by management ' s attempts on tuesday to pacify investor concerns about transactions involving enron , its chief financial officer , and two limited partnerships - all of which are being looked into by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
enron on tuesday rejected suggestions the transactions were a conflict of interest , saying the deals were disclosed in sec filings and approved by its board and internal and external auditors .
enron , which reported a loss and a $ 1 . 01 billion in charges for bad investments in the third - quarter , failed to mention a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder value , and was less than forthcoming during a call with analysts and investors the next day .

cnnfn : market coverage - morning
( c ) copyright federal document clearing house . all rights reserved .
christine romans , cnnfn anchor , market call : now , joining us by phone to talk about his move on enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) is anatol feygin , energy analyst at jp morgan . thank you for joining us .
anatol feygin , jp morgan : thanks for having me .
romans : ok . enron , last week , these shares lost some 28 or 29 percent of their value , continued to fall yesterday , and monday . what ` s going on here why you ` re downgrade - how concerned are you about in visibility management in the issues that we ` re talking about here ?
feygin : well , extremely concerned and until thursday of last week , i felt that a lot the information coming out was old news and was not critical to the fundamentals of the company . on friday of last week the credit market started to really get jittery and spreads on enron ` s credit started to blow out and that could threaten the fundamental business . yesterday management had a opportunity to set the record straight on a conference call . i think that was a big opportunity missed . and until management comes out and reassures the credit markets , primarily , and then the equities markets , there is risk to the fundamental business which i still consider to be the premiere energy marketing and trading franchise that ` s functioning well today , but it at risk because of credit issues .
barry hyman , ehrenkrantz king nussbaum : anatol , what exactly are these off balance sheets financing vehicle , that is of concern here , that management been reluctant to talk about ?
feygin : there are two transaction still left . one called marlin and one called white wing or osprey . in marlin , it ` s basically a 1 / 3 ownership of a u . k water utility that enron acquired in the october of ` 98 . part of that taken public and ` 99 . that was bought back in by enron this year . and problem is that entity , the assets of zurichs , which has this wessex water business in the u . k . , are not enough to payoff the creditors in marlin . so , enron is on the hook for a portion of the equity that has back stopped this investment by marlin . and we estimate that to be in the hundreds of millions not in the billion dollar range , which i think the market fears .
white wing is a very similar structure , less transparent because that ` s a collection of assets . things like , roughly half of enron ` s investment in brazil , its european power plants and et cetera and it ` s difficult to reconcile of what value of those asset is . and there is a possibly that enron have issue up to 2 . 4 billion in equity to make whole the investors in white wing .
romans : ok , anatol feygin , jp morgan , thank you very much . lots of other analysts saying that the conference call with the company didn ` t really clear up some of the questions they had .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones france telecom was unchanged from tuesday at 180 / 195 bps , and deutsche telecom was down about 10 bps at 140 / 150 bps , traders added . vodafone was quoted two basis points lower from late tuesday at 83 / 93 bps , with telefonica put at 100 / 110 bps in five - year default swaps , about five basis points lower .
stronger equity prices helped alleviate some concerns about the telecom sector ' s financial health , although problems remain for many firms labouring under heavy debt burdens , a dealer for a european bank said .
he added that some default swap selling pressure was coming from players arranging synthetic portfolio products such as collateralised debt obligations ( cdos ) before the end of the year . cdos are portfolios of bonds and other debt obligations . the arranger issues bonds , secured by the underlying assets to fund the deal . in a synthetic cdo , the arranger sells default swaps on groups of debt in one hit to mimic the asset pool .
elsewhere , dealers saw small declines in protection costs on the debt of carmakers , with u . s . - german giant daimlerchrysler trading several times .
a u . s . bank dealer nonethless saw it little changed on the day in five - year default swaps at 190 / 200 bps .

enron may need several hundred mln usd to meet shortfalls at investment units
10 / 24 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
london ( afx ) - enron corp might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more in the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created , the wall street journal reported , citing an interview with enron treasurer ben glisan .
covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional enron shares , diluting the position of current shareholders , the paper said .
however , glisan said the company believes it can repay about 3 . 3 bln usd in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock .
the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities - - known as the marlin water trust ii , the marlin water capital corp ii , the osprey trust and osprey i inc . the notes are coming due during the next 20 months .
glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes . also , enron is selling other assets . proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes , which ultimately are guaranteed by enron .
he said it appears that asset sales will raise at least 2 . 2 bln usd by the end of next year . this amount includes cash proceeds of 1 . 55 bln usd from the previously announced sale of enron ' s portland general electric utility unit .
"" there are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds "" to repay the notes , glisan was quoted as saying . "" but if we are wrong , we will issue equity . ""
glisan said a worst - case scenario would involve issuing as much as 1 bln usd in stock . enron said it has about 850 mln shares outstanding .
making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in enron ' s share price . during the past week , shares of the energy - trading giant have dropped more than 40 pct .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones anything more than 9 % is considered ultra - high risk . so while you can make 11 % , that ' s still not enough "" where the accounting is questionable , "" one bond trader says . "" you ' re not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default . you have to worry about your recovery value . ""
not the kind of risk / reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $ 12 . 5 billion with a capital b .
speaking of bonds and stocks : even with its stock at about $ 1 . 16 , global crossing ( gx : nyse - news - commentary ) still has a market cap that exceeds $ 1 billion . but while its stock has rallied , its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar . similar stories can be told for xo communications ( xoxo : nasdaq - news - commentary ) , with a market cap of about $ 473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar ; level 3 communications ( lvlt : nasdaq - news - commentary ) , with a market cap of $ 1 . 2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents ; and mcleodusa ( mcld : nasdaq - news - commentary ) , with a market cap of $ 462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents .
where are opportunistic bond investors , who should be hopping on such cheap debt - - especially bank debt , which is at the top of the getting - paid - back food chain ? they ' re nowhere to be seen , for the same reasons they ' re not jumping to buy enron ' s bonds : too much risk , because when companies like those go bad , their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading . ( try telling that to "" hope - springs - eternal "" stock investors ! )
providian pratfalls : turns out an item here back in may was more fortuitous than it appeared . the item noted how institutional bond investors , who often pony up a slight premium to libor to buy so - called credit default - protection insurance , couldn ' t find any at any price for providian ( pvn : nyse - news - commentary ) . the insurance is sold by investment banks such as j . p . morgan chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade . if nobody ' ll take the other side of the trade - - or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so - - investors should beware . which brings us back to enron : it is possible to buy credit insurance , but at more than a whopping 1 , 000 basis points over libor . hardly a vote of confidence .

accounting irregularities = sell . those three words and an equals sign have always served me well . they remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine , always in view . they have never let me down . when i have deviated from them i have had to pay severely , as i did when i ignored the accounting irregularities in cendant ( cd : nyse - news - commentary ) initially or when , because of my four - month holding period , i couldn ' t sell qwest ( q : nyse - news - commentary ) .
which is why i came in with guns blazing on this enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) , telling you to sell it . the stock has now lost half its value and all i can say is , i still can ' t see why you have to tempt fate and own this one . the notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound , that it has a great core business , is just hokum . who the heck knows ? who has any idea of what this company can really earn ? who knows what it did earn ?
all i know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the democrats that the justice department is playing political favorites by not pursuing enron ( noted republican - giving company ) for alleged fraud .
when that happens , when that shoe drops , wherever enron is , then maybe it is worth some scrutiny .
but i bet i still won ' t like it .

if you disclose something that is wrong , and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed , and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed , is it therefore right ?
that ' s what enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) is asking us to believe . by telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals , they have simply compounded the error . next they will tell us that janus , the largest shareholder , knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises !
what they are doing at enron is , well , positively - - here we go - - ' 80 s ! in the ' 80 s , you had all of these savings - and - loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery . somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher .
nope .
what it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble . the government ended up going after them , too , for abetting the travesties .
enron didn ' t use taxpayers ' money , so it is arguably not as clear - cut . but the more we probe this enron , the more we check it out , the more we know it really stinks and that jeffrey skilling didn ' t leave because the stock got hammered , or some other authentic wall street gibberish , but because of this nasty , unseemly situation .
we don ' t want an sec probe here . we want a justice department probe . this isn ' t about unclear disclosure . this could end up being about fraud .
in the meantime , i wouldn ' t touch this stock with a 10 - foot pole . this one ' s gonna get real nasty before it gets nice . if it ever does .

enron ' s disdain for investors
the motley fool . com
10 / 24 / 01
while recent coverage of enron centers on the cfo ' s past partnerships , a smaller - - and more obvious - - omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company . not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter ' s conference call and press release , something we don ' t like but is prevalent , it also doesn ' t release its balance sheet . the company must think we ' re idiots . they ' re wrong .

october 24 , 2001
enron ' s ( nyse : ene ) > troubles just don ' t stop . on monday , the company announced > that the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) had requested information on "" certain related party transactions > . "" that was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by enron cfo andrew fastow . there has been a flurry - - a hailstorm - - of financial media attention to this . there are only three possibilities , and none is palatable :
the company ' s board allowed this deal in order to - - using corporate speak - - "" incentivize "" the cfo , and it was not legal ;
it was legal , but unethical ; or
enron has been less than forthcoming , perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark .
the accounting machinations involve mind - numbing terms and obfuscation , making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide . the new york times ' floyd norris calls them "" some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen . "" that leads me to one conclusion when i think about burying myself with the company ' s sec filings , accounting texts , my high - speed web connection , and some beer : that of shakespeare ' s king lear - - "" that way madness lies . ""
on the one hand , i know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting , reading financial statements , and finding trouble . ( to read what this is all about , check the "" certain transactions "" section of the company ' s latest proxy statement > . ) i fully intend to do that - - someday . for now , though , all i need to know about enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent .
what ' s worse , though , is that enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark , and not only about the potentially troublesome cfo issue . the company goes out of its way to hide its true financials . that really cheeses me off .
the quarterly call and press release parade
most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases ( for which the companies pay good money to business wire and pr newswire for dissemination ) that allegedly state their latest quarter ' s numbers and talk about the business . sometimes , when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers , execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead . at least thanks to regulation fair disclosure > - - "" reg . fd "" - - analysts don ' t get a secret call with the "" real "" numbers at another time than the public . we like that .
perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers > and ebitda > - - both of which phil weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns - - the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive . that makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of "" bullfeathers ! "" it only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic . the pr department carefully dresses them with spin , leaving the details for the fine print . headline : "" earnings up ! "" ( revenues down 40 % . ) headline : "" revenues up ! "" ( earnings down 40 % . ) the skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness > .
at least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business , but the financials are not helpful . why ?
hiding the cash flow statement
because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time . if the income statement is increasingly unhelpful , at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash , right ? well , not quite .
you really need the cash flow statement - - the best measure of how the company ' s business actually performs . even then , you may need to make further adjustments > . yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time .
check the companies you own . if they don ' t release cash flow statements with their earnings - - or , at least , prior to sec filings , you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so . encourage your fellow investors to do so too , and tell the company that the motley fool sent ya . they will maintain that the numbers aren ' t ready at earnings time . tell them to wait until they are . the numbers are certainly ready in time for the sec deadline , and wouldn ' t we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture ? or , hey , why not do two releases - - one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow ?
if not releasing the cash flow statement were enron ' s only sin , it wouldn ' t be that big a deal . it has plenty of company . but this pre - halloween > scary tale gets worse . unfortunately for enron investors , the company does the hide - the - cash - flow - statement gig one better .
hiding the balance sheet
for at least the last three quarters that i checked , enron hides the balance sheet until sec filing time . that ' s right : not just the cash flow statement , but the balance sheet too . all they release is the income statement - - though , in truth , it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses . but why fail to release the balance sheet ?
the only conclusion can be that management doesn ' t want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into sec filings it thinks people won ' t bother to read . when questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former enron ceo jeffrey skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release , skilling reportedly "" called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners . ""
off his meds that day ? or a symptom of the company ' s attitude towards shareholders ? looks like the latter : skilling ' s gone , but the practice hasn ' t changed .
it ' s about management
we don ' t depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases . a publicly traded company ' s financials will appear a few weeks later through its sec filings available through our quotes & data page > . no investor should be buying - - or holding - - stock in companies if they don ' t read their filings carefully . it ' s hard enough to discern what ' s going on in a business without doing so , and even in those filings - - such as with options grants to management - - the real meat is buried in footnotes . not reading 10 - qs and 10 - ks is like getting married without dating , or buying a car by paint color only .
what enron ' s failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub - par . it says management is willing to hold these events , but it ' ll be darned if it ' ll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management ' s spin . in enron ' s case , its former ceo heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change . does that make enron ' s earnings releases circuses ? draw your own conclusion .
is management listening ? perhaps . it hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday . tmf community member emschulze took notes > :
"" on call , analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company ' s previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance . . . response was that balance sheet doesn ' t normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10 - q to be filed by nov . 14 . . . ceo indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future , implying that investors won ' t have to wait all the way until 10 - q filing deadlines to see balance sheet . ""
that ' s a good sign . but until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time , enron should be in the doghouse .
good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today ' s income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless . if it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together , what ' s the problem ? shareholders should demand no less . when a company trumpets an income statement , as enron has , no one should be surprised when smoke appears . and perhaps much more .
tom jacobs ( tmf tom 9 ) would like to improve his own cash flow statement . at press time , he owned no shares of enron . to see his stock holdings , view his profile > , and check out the motley fool ' s disclosure policy . >

new york - ( dow jones ) - the bonds of embattled enron corp . ( ene ) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader .
the bonds , which carry investment - grade ratings , "" started trading with a dollar price two days ago , "" said gary brown , managing director and head of corporate trading , wachovia securities , charlotte , n . c .
bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80 ' s to low 90 ' s , say traders .
investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable treasury issues . "" credit bonds , "" which have questions about their quality , are traded in dollar quotes , said one analyst .
moody ' s investors service rates the company ' s senior unsecured debt baal , but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade . both standard & poor ' s corp . and fitch rate the debt triple - b - plus .

usa : group to put corporate directors under microscope .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , oct 24 ( reuters ) - directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group the corporate library , the group ' s cofounder said on wednesday .
in a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country , long - time shareholder activist nell minow said directors will be awarded grades of a , b , c and lower , based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks .
"" it ' s always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds . directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve , "" said minow , who said the service will be called board analyst .
planned as an added feature on an existing web site , . com , board analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year , she said .
only directors of u . s . companies will initially be evaluated . non - u . s . directors may be added later .
minow and partner robert monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights . they formerly managed the washington - based shareholder activist lens fund , which they sold last year to british fund management group hermes .
their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy - side , said industry spokespersons .
"" there ' s been growing interest within our membership in board membership , in general , and individual directors , in particular . i definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors , "" said ann yerger , spokeswoman for the council of institutional investors , which represents america ' s large pension funds .
the corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970 s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible . many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors . but examples of lax board oversight still abound .
one example would be enron corp . , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the securities and exchange commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company ' s chief financial officer , minow said .
"" where was the enron board in all of this ? "" she asked . "" boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these . that apparently didn ' t happen here . ""
taking the corporate governance argument a step further , minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question . it should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company .
"" this isn ' t just a corporate governance thing . this is part of investment analysis , "" she said .
institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks . whether they will begin to examine directors , as well , remained an open question .
"" nell and bob monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction , "" said peter gleason , vice president of research and development at the national association of corporate directors , which represents more than 3 , 000 corporate directors .
surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self - evaluation high on their list of concerns . "" more and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing , "" gleason said .

"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading
strategy
please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some
typos .
greg and john ,
i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of
trades ( keeping the
total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose
market move from
$ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread
is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5
trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is
( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading
volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one
trade , the total mtm is
- 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading
strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that
particular day .
therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the
number of trades , we can be more
profitable as a market maker .
i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per
trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .
i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades
by factor of 3 . almost in all
cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for
dollar amount change in millions .
please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .
regards ,
zimin lu

"Subject: re : network planning
stinson , i had a discussion with jim and he said that the company ' s name is
mill three . they provide modeling tools for tiered qos and the like for
network planning . he said that the code is written in c and that we should
be able to work with it . he will get us the contact name and we can get a
presentation for us . jim said that he arranged for this before he met me and
learned of our ( ebs research ) role in this matter . i made it clear to jim
that john griebling had asked us to set up this group to do modeling and that
we are in the process of arranging for 4 or modeling experts to reside in
houston . from now on jim and i will work hand and hand on such issues along
with you to make sure that we initiate development efforts as soon as
possible to utilize krishna , samer and co . asap . . .
i ' ll take care of arranging a meeting with these consultatants asap .
my involvement in hamachi is through jim irvine . jim and i are working very
well together due to our engineering background . jim has been a network
( communications ) engineer in the army for about 20 years . for hamachi , there
were gap analysis that needed to be done w . r . t . network reach and when and
where the network will be available ( ebs ' and hamachi ' s ) . additionally , we
would look at when tom gros wanted pooling points up and running , we would
then look at hamachi ' s pooling point sites and come up with requests to
change dates or third party involvements .
for the most part , our efforts has been to interview hamachi network
developers about their plans and put the data together in a manner that we
can summarize for john . additionally , we ' ve had two meetings with sycamore
( they have offices in denver ) on their products and brett gave a presentation
on his effort to jim , etc . . . . more details later when we meet .

"Subject: california 3 / 23
executive summary :
bottom line - qfs better off today , utilities in worse shape
after passing senate , the qf bill fails on technical grounds in assembly
cal energy ruling provides possible escape for qfs from utility commitments
california net short gas supply for the summer worsens if qfs break contracts
hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper , further litigation expected
1 . qf bill fails in surprise twist
ab 8 x ( the qf bill ) failed in the assembly ( 48 - 24 ) . the republicans were opposed because three measures , the sdg & e fix , the ab lx fix , and the qf fix were all rolled into one bill by the senate . they want the three measures split up . concern was raised by san diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in sb 43 x . as noted yesterday , the qfs will now await a cpuc ruling on tuesday .
2 . cal energy ruling sets stage for "" dozens "" of similar q . f . suits
the cpuc ruling is now less important because of the cal energy ruling yesterday , which gave the qfs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities . cal energy reportedly would have filed an involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow ( friday ) had they not won their law suit . dozens , if not hundreds of suits identical to that filed by calenergy can now be expected from the other qfs . the qfs reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct into the merchant market , possibly out - of - state . they also want to avoid any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a stage 2 or stage 3 alert , and will contest any such measure with the ferc .
3 . summer outlook worsens
the outlook for the summer now appears much grimmer for the state . if the gas - fired qfs alone manage to extricate themselves from their contracts with the utilities , the state will be a net 10 , 000 mw short for the summer rather than 5 , 000 mw . this is a much larger net short position to fill , and will be much harder for state treasurer angelides to sell to wall street . if all of the qfs break their contracts , the state will be 14 , 000 to 15 , 000 mw short . essentially , if the qfs are successful in court ( as it appears they would be ) , they are no longer part of the pool of low , fixed - rate power that the state can count on . the onus now appears to be on treasurer angelides to come up with a rate schedule . the qfs may go to him and ask for the state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts ( the state would , of course , charge for this privilege ) and negotiate a more flexible rate structure .
4 pressure mounts on utilities
none of this helps the utilities ' situation . in fact , now that the qfs have a way out of their contracts through the courts , it appears that the business base of the utilities is reduced , so they are actually in a worse situation . reportedly some of the utilities ' commercial paper now has been sold to hedge funds . as one source put it , "" the vultures have moved in . "" these are "" the types of people who litigate . """,0

john / louise :
brian stanley and i discussed his proposal to consolidate the enron america development engineers under eeos . as you know , there is a lot of noise in the system with respect this topic that is detracting from productivity . i suggest that we need to make a definite decision on whether or not the ena tech services group will be consolidated into eeos or will they remain as a separate group under ena . the stakeholders in this decision include the power / gas origination teams ( e . g . duran , jacoby , calger , etc . ) the various technical groups , and rac . these groups should be consulted to ensure that whatever we do meets their requirements .
i have asked brian s . to arrange a meeting when he returns from his trip on or about june 11 th ( with louise on the phone ) to discuss . this will also ensure we get past some key dates in our construction projects .

"Subject: alliance may test the system up to 1 . 5 bcf / d in next two weeks
strong demand holds load factors high despite alliance
the introduction of the 1 . 325 bcf / d alliance pipeline into the north american
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western
canada than expected , according to representatives of transcanada pipelines ,
pg & e gas transmission and alliance . extremely strong gas demand in the
pacific northwest , california and in the midwest has produced continued high
load factors on transcanada and pg & e gt - nw despite the presence of their huge
new rival for western canadian supply .
"" the contract picture changed significantly on [ transcanada ] since the first
of november and primarily at our empress , ab , delivery point into the
transcanada mainline from the alberta pipe , but actual physical gas flows [ at
about 6 bcf / d ] have not changed correspondingly , "" said klaus exner , director
of pipeline system operations at transcanada . "" the big picture overview that
i would give you is that demand is very high in the pacific northwest and
california and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down
that leg of our pipeline system out of alberta , through british columbia and
into the pg & e systems . that hasn ' t let up at all and we don ' t foresee that
letting up . ""
pg & e gas transmission spokeswoman sandra mcdonough said pg & e gt - nw has been
running full at 2 . 6 bcf / d for some time and is delivering 900 mmcf / d to
non - california load in the pacific northwest . "" we ' re turning back demand
right now . every power plant in this region is running full tilt . tuscarora
[ gas transmission ] , the nevada pipeline , is full . our northwest deliveries
are fixed . we ' re delivering as much as we can deliver right now . ""
transcanada ' s other major export route out of the western canadian
sedimentary basin is the foothills and northern border route into the
midwest . it also continues to operate at high load factors . "" we didn ' t see a
huge drop - off in physical flows post nov . 1 . we ' ve seen the it volumes come
up considerably , "" said exner . "" the one thing that has changed is the
volatility of the flows . customers are making frequent intraday nomination
changes and we ' re seeing more up and down and day - to - day variations ,
according to the weather and the markets , than we would have when we had a
higher firm contract level . the fluctuations are driven purely by the price
differential between aeco and the dawn hub in ontario , which indicates
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not . ""
alliance pipeline spokesman jack crawford said the system has been running
flat out at about 1 . 325 bcf / d since the valves were opened for commercial
service dec . 1 . he also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase
flows on the system . it has been estimated that alliance could increase gas
flows to 1 . 5 bcf / d with existing compression . the additional capacity would
be divided up among existing shippers , crawford said . "" we haven ' t cranked up
the system above the contract capacity yet . we probably won ' t do that for a
couple weeks until we get things ironed out . frankly though , i ' m not sure
chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the pacific
northwest and california . ""

subject : trend analysis for select commodity groups
attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have
either been demonstrating , or have been thought to be demonsrating , a decline
in eol transactions as a percentage of total trading activity . the graphs for
each group represent a line plot of eol ' s weekly percentage of total trading
activity by deal count and volume over the last three months . the attachment
also contains source data on the second and third pages , which gives the
absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs . these
sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a
decreasing or erratic eol trend , but were not graphed because they averaged
less than 10 - 15 total transactions ( both eol and non - eol ) per week .
a few notes on the four graphed commodity groups :
austrian power - the overall eol trend as a percentage of transactions in
austrian power has been upward over the last three months , despite the sharp ,
temporary decrease which took place at the end of july as a result of the
head austrian power trader and stack manager going on holiday . since his
return , the percentage has picked back up and as of 8 / 22 about 30 % of
austrian power trades were once again being done through eol . there is cause
for concern here , however , in the fact that the absence of one trader
effectively shut off eol trading in this commodity group .
lpg - the lpg products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception ,
with eol transactions typically accounting for between 20 and 30 percent of
total lpg trading activity . this overall trend remains intact and as of 8 / 22 ,
eol accounted for 26 % of lpg trades .
crude & products - this commodity group has been demonstrating a steady
decline in eol trading activity over the last three months . while eol trades
accounted for approximately 20 % of all crude and products activity in may ,
this percentage has dropped off to just over 10 % as of august 22 nd . this
trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy , as well as the
relatively large data pool on which it is based .
uk power - although the absolute number of trades in uk power dropped off
significantly at the end of july , eol ' s percentage of uk power transactions
has remained fairly stable . eol ' s percentage of uk power trades "" spiked ""
briefly during the second week of june , but outside of this the percentage of
uk power trading represented by eol transactions has fluctuated between 20
and 40 percent . on trade date 8 - 22 , eol transactions accounted for just over
50 % of all transactions done in uk power .",0

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

hi there stranger !
well i haven ' t spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and i ' m just
checkin ' to see that my lil ' buddy in portland isn ' t working himself too
hard . as you know i tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for a
workout and a scrimmage soccer game . i am so sore ! it ' s out of control !
ok so down to the real reason i ' m writing . brendan and i had a great time
at happy hour . we talked a little about you but mostly about life in
general . he had mentioned that he had e - mailed me so i rushed home to check
it .
basically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me as
odd . i guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunt .
he had written that although you thought i was cool and whatever you had
commented on how "" strange "" the situation was and he sort of elaborated on
that .
so the point of this e - mail is i guess to reassure you that i only have the
best intentions towards you . i am not trying to be your girlfriend or
anything similar to that . to tell you the truth i don ' t even know what your
"" romantic "" situation is . i just think you are an awesome guy whom i ' d love
to become close friends with .
i am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in huntington beach ( if you
still are ) and i ' m thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together . i
bragged and bragged to brendan about what a great guy you were and then came
home to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances . i really am
just a very overly affectionate and loving person ( not to mention
spontaneous ) . i didn ' t mean to scare you away from having a great
friendship with me and me with you .
for heavens sake you are my portland connection and i ' m your beach bum
buddy . honestly if i were a psycho i would have jumped at the chance to
come up and see your condo when you offered . i just think you are someone
i ' d love to get to know . especially if you are anything like brendan ( which
best friends usually are ) he is such a sweetie ! when he and meg go to visit
her mom in la they might just stop over for a visit and of course they are
welcome to stay with me as well .
i guess i never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and to
be quite honest i didn ' t even think to ask brendan because it ' s not
important . i want you , bill , for your friendship and for your companionship
now and when i move to portland . reflecting back i realize that i may have
written or said something that caught you off guard . it ' s just my
personality . i ' m a huge flirt . for heavens sake i was voted "" most
flirtatious "" my senior year not to mention "" most likely to succeed "" .
probably the second one due to the first but who knows ! hahaha ! i ' m only
teasing .
ok seriously now bill , i want you to be honest . if i did ( locating your
condo etc . ) or said ( like that was the most romantic thing i had ever read
that was written by a guy ) something to upset you or give you a false
impression i am so sorry . i do find you attractive and perhaps if we lived
in the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter i knew
your "" romantic "" stiuation , yeah i would have jumped at the chance to have
dated you . but we didn ' t and the truth is i can never have too many
friends . especially good looking ones that i can introduce to all my "" girl ""
friends so that they can be jealous with envy ! : )
like i said i only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds our
relationship as friends . but if you are uncomfortable with something i ' ve
done or said i am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or e - mail
me and you ' ll never hear from me again . scouts honor ! i ' ve never been a
scout but i ' m not know for my lies either . teehee .
i would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to our
realtionship as friends . if i can i ' ll put your mind at ease if not well i
enjoyed our short 30 minute interlude . as always you are still welcome to
come visit me and stay with me i would love to have the company .
if i don ' t hear form you within the next couple of weeks i ' ll assume the
worst but still try to keep my schedule as flexible as possible in case you
change your mind . i ' m lucky in the fact that i can do that sort of thing !
: ) ok just e - mail me or call me . let me know that you are alive and
kickin ' .
i ' ll be leaving for calgary , canada this thursday morning at 6 am and will
be there until the 16 th . i ' m so excited this is my first trip out of
country but then again you know that ! so i guess i ' ll hear from you when i
hear from you .
i just thought of a last possible reason . . . i may be way off base here but i
am not sure if you know the situation between my boyfriend and myself . he
is a real sweetheart and he ' s going to make a wonderful husband and
father . . . just not with me . if you are concerned about our friendship and
him becoming weird well the majority of my friends are guys and todd is
secure enough in himself that he doesn ' t care . if this is about august and
you staying with me , my father is moving me down not him and it will be a
long time until he can come to visit . also when i get there we are not
going to continue a long distance exclusive relationship . i haven ' t dated
or had much of a wild stage and i have told him that we will see other
people . he ' s fine with that as well .
ok i admit that his potland stunt was a little irrational but hey i thought
it was thoughtful and darling . i love surprises and little "" extras "" . i
just didn ' t expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guy
to someone whom i ' d never met . therefore i did everything in my power to
rectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused this .
you think i ' m a psycho ! not to mention i had to face brendan and before he
could read my e - mail you had already revealed the stroy to him ! ! so i got
to be embarrssed and a little humbled by the whole experience !
ok that ' s it . take it however you will but it ' s 12 : 51 am and i ' m exhausted !
i did the best i could to figure out and fix a possibly non - existing
problem . i hope i did well enough to inspire a response from you . : ) hope
to hear or read from you soon !
goodnight and god bless ,

"Subject: interesting article from motley fool
ceo departure puzzles enron investors
when enron ' s president and ceo suddenly and unexpectedly announced he was
leaving the company earlier this week , the stock got hammered due to the
increased uncertainty . the exact reasons for the departure are puzzling and
remain a mystery , and this is probably not the last chapter we ' ll hear in
this story .
by paul larson ( tmf parlay )
august 17 , 2001
the plot around enron ( nyse : ene ) has thickened . on tuesday evening , the
commodities market maker ' s president and ceo , jeffrey skilling , said that
he was leaving his posts for "" personal reasons . "" skilling had spent most of
his career rising through the ranks at enron and had manned the ceo post
since february . many saw skilling as quite brash , sharp , egotistical , and
one who brought more than his fair share of youthful energy to the
"" new - age "" enron .
but now that skilling has resigned , chairman kenneth lay - - the man
skilling took the reins from - - will again act as president and ceo until a
permanent replacement is found . lay was enron ' s ceo from 1985 until earlier
this year , and he was largely behind the company ' s push to become the
wholesale trading powerhouse it is today after years as a sleepy gas line
operator . ( for more on the energy industry , see our latest issue of the
motley fool select . )
so why did skilling bail ?
the first reason skilling cited for his departure was the very vague
"" personal reasons . "" both the company and skilling denied the resignation
was for health reasons of any kind , and the secrecy and resultant
uncertainty has sent the stock diving , losing roughly $ 6 ( or about 14 % ) of
market value on extremely heavy volume in the two trading days since the
announcement was made .
the move is especially puzzling since the departure is hitting skilling in
the pocketbook - - hard . since skilling is leaving voluntarily , he will not
receive a severance package that would have reportedly been worth more than
$ 20 million in cash and stock had he been forcefully pushed out . even if
skilling had been doing a terrible job at enron , one would think he would
stick around and wait for the axe to fall instead of leaving on his own ,
given that potential windfall .
the departure is even more riddling when one considers a roughly $ 2 million
loan outstanding that enron has to skilling . if skilling had been canned ,
this loan would have been forgiven . more importantly , if skilling had
fulfilled his employment contract to the end of the year - - a mere four
more months - - skilling could have kept this $ 2 million free and clear . how
many folks do you know who pass up $ 2 million for four months of work ?
yet another oddity in this case is the wall street journal ' s report that
one of the reasons skilling left was because of enron ' s faltering share
price . ironically , the fashion in which he has left has been directly
responsible for causing the shares to breach a new annual low .
many long - time enron investors may remember when skilling brashly called
enron ' s shares undervalued back in january , saying the stock should trade
above $ 120 . but since skilling took the helm , the stock has done nothing
but fall , losing over half its value in the past six months . even though
much of the stock ' s weakness had nothing to do with the company ' s operating
performance , the pressure of not living up to that bullish projection was
supposedly very difficult for skilling .
still , the exact reasons for the sudden departure remain a mystery today .
both skilling and the company deny there were any accounting problems or
other improprieties behind the resignation , and both continue to speak
quite positively about enron . but for a company that has a reputation of
strong management , this week ' s activities are highly out of character .
investors may be unsatisfied with the current state of affairs and
information , but for the time being there ' s little to do but stay tuned .",0

with all our reporting changing to london office and now it appears some
restructure of risk and the broadening of sally ' s role , what are we going to
do for the second report for our new risk manager , justin den hertog - he has
taken over from alan .
he reports to me locally , but functionally he would traditionally have
reported to you on behalf of sally ' s area . i assume this has now moved with
the rest of us and would therefore be either james new or mike jordan in
london ? can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our
pep stuff , reviews etc .

dynegy vs . enron :
a "" tale of two companies ""
by will mcnamara
director , electric industry analysis
facts : dynegy inc . ( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry .
let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues .
as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector .
dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , "" dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . "" ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business .
the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities .
on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio .
consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "" great debate "" among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . "" our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , "" lay said . "" the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . ""
moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company "" could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital "" and that enron "" spent too much too soon "" in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter .
dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business .
it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions .
at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous .
in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies .

"Subject: a colossal and dangerous failure - cera alert
title : a colossal and dangerous failure
url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2185
overview : western energy  * california governor stays the course
california governor gray davis provided his strongest public statements to
date regarding the state  , s power crisis in his annual state of the state
address on january 8 , 2001 . echoing many of his previous positions on what he
perceives as a flawed and unfair california market structure , the governor
labeled the state  , s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous
failure . among other actions , he launched new initiatives valued at $ 1
billion to encourage conservation , provide financing and land to new
generators , grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of
transactions to manage electricity costs , and increase regulatory scrutiny of
existing market suppliers . the governor also called for a greater role for
the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants .
the governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the
steps necessary to put california on the road to recovery . details regarding
sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming . although he
stated that california  , s investor - owned utilities must not be allowed to go
bankrupt , no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given . the financial
community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provide
financial backing for pacific gas and electric and southern california
edison . at this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to
guarantee their solvency .
the governor again criticized the federal energy regulatory commission for
what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the
wholesale market . merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the
state , and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their
operations , jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid . new , more severe
sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting what
investigators find as unreasonable profits .
a los angeles times poll released the morning before the governor  , s address
indicated that the majority of californians still do not believe there is an
energy crisis . although the 33 percent growth in the state  , s economy over the
past ten years has nearly outstripped the state  , s and surrounding region  , s
supplies of power , the bulk of the governor  , s statements continue to focus on
the culpability of power producers , rather than the serious supply shortfall .
though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the construction
of new generating plants , increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of
sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers
and the financial community that the investment climate in california is
excessively risky .

homeland security investments
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 20 ol have
changed
the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and
logical
security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in
the

opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filling with water .
as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the

washington - - if enron corp . goes under , the government is unlikely to throw it a lifeline .
at its peak , enron was a major participant in the country ' s financial and energy markets . but economic and financial policy makers say they aren ' t worried about any broader blow to markets or business activity . despite frequent comparisons to long - term capital management , the hedge fund whose 1998 nose dive panicked global financial markets and triggered an unusual bailout brokered by the federal reserve , there has been so far no public sign of any attempt by the fed , the treasury or energy regulators to take similar action on behalf of enron or its creditors .
officials from a range of economic and regulatory agencies have insisted in recent days that while they have been closely monitoring enron ' s situation , they haven ' t seen any reason to be concerned about possible ripple effects . enron "" is just one piece of a very big market , "" said john mielke , chief of market surveillance at the commodity futures trading commission . mr . mielke said he saw no evidence that enron ' s problems have disrupted trading on the futures exchanges monitored by the cftc .
"" these are deep and pretty big markets that enron is in , "" echoed william gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas .
it is too soon to say exactly what the total damage from enron ' s potential demise will be . one danger is that a blowup in the company ' s complex , largely unregulated portfolio of derivatives could infect financial markets in wide and unpredictable ways , just as ltcm ' s did . another worry : that the collapse of a major middleman in natural - gas and power markets could disrupt supplies .
enron does share some characteristics with ltcm , including widespread activities in complicated financial instruments in numerous markets , with little detailed public explanation of those activities , and little regulatory oversight of those trades .
its public disclosures suggest enron ' s exposures are substantial . a quarterly filing listed $ 18 . 7 billion in assets and an equal amount of liabilities related to "" price risk management activities "" as of sept . 30 . the filing gives no description or breakdown of those amounts and little detail about the derivatives in which enron transacts as a normal part of business . ( a derivative is a financial contract whose value is designed to track the return on stocks , bonds , currencies or other benchmark . ) an enron spokeswoman didn ' t return a call seeking comment .
as enron ' s woes deepened , the government ' s hands were tied in even assessing the situation , in part because the company was part of a coalition of energy companies and banks that lobbied successfully three years ago against cftc efforts to expand regulation of the over - the - counter energy market . enron also worked behind the scene to head off cftc ' s direct regulation of the energy concern ' s enrononline trading operation .
there have been some signs in markets of concerns about enron fallout . interest rates on bonds of utilities and energy companies rose by one - to two - tenths of a percentage point relative to treasurys yesterday . by day ' s end , the dow jones industrial average was off 160 . 74 points , a decline blamed in part on the enron news .
those are relatively small hiccups . the betting is the impact of enron ' s troubles on the financial system will be widespread but thin . enron was a favorite borrower among lenders , and its loans were among the most widely syndicated among the banking system , both at home and abroad . for example , a $ 2 . 25 billion credit facility arranged for enron in may by citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . was distributed to 50 different institutions , according to loan pricing corp . , a credit - market research company . those syndication members sold off chunks of that debt to other investors , according to a banker at one of the underwriters .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement that it has $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines . while this exposure is expected to smart , it represents a small fraction of j . p . morgan chase ' s total assets of $ 715 billion . citigroup declined to comment on its exposure to enron , but officials familiar with the matter said the bank ' s exposure is similar to that of j . p . morgan chase .
beyond financial fallout , a concern is the potential impact on energy markets and what that could do to the economy . enron ' s troubles could hamper efforts to end the recession if the company ' s difficulties make it impossible for it to deliver natural gas or electricity to its customers .
natural - gas prices rose sharply yesterday in the minutes after three major credit - rating agencies downgraded enron ' s rating and dynegy inc . said it was calling off its purchase . but the move quickly reversed when traders digested gas - inventory numbers released in the afternoon that showed utilities have stored enough gas to meet demand ahead of the winter heating season .
"" we ' ve seen no interruptions in physical deliveries and no pricing reaction in the futures markets that you could attribute to enron , "" said scott miller , director of market development for the federal energy regulatory commission . "" revenues and transactions are occurring normally as far as we can tell . ""

enron ' s woes may ripple out to others - - - if energy company files for bankruptcy , results are likely to be messy

the sudden , deep financial troubles of enron corp . , the once aggressive , many - tentacled energy conglomerate , could have widespread consequences for scores of companies across the economy .
if enron files for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , as many investors and financial experts now expect , it is likely to be one of the messiest , most complex bankruptcy cases ever , lawyers say .
that is because of the multifaceted nature of enron ' s once highflying operations , which combined a global energy business with a massive financial - trading operation involving tens of billions of dollars in complex contracts . yesterday , amid the unraveling of a last - ditch merger with dynegy inc . , the company ' s credit was downgraded to "" junk "" status by rating agency standard & poor ' s corp . enron has about 800 trading partners or creditors .
the stock market , signaling that a bankruptcy filing is expected , hammered enron stock , which was halted for a time yesterday , and knocked lower some of its financial backers ' shares . enron shares closed at 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , or 85 % . enron bonds also fell sharply , dropping to 50 cents on the dollar from around 55 cents , reflecting concerns over how much creditors might receive if the company does seek bankruptcy - court protection . j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , which have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of keeping the enron - dynegy deal alive , also saw their stocks fall . at 4 p . m . in nyse composite trading , j . p . morgan shares were down $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , while citigroup shares were down $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement it has about $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit , and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines .
other companies also disclosed their exposures to enron . exelon corp . , an energy concern in chicago , said its power - trading arm has a direct net exposure to enron of less than $ 10 million , based on its current book of business and existing market prices . exelon said its direct gross exposure based on sales to enron is less than $ 20 million . exelon said this is partly offset by $ 10 million that it owes to enron .
still , while the fallout from a potential bankruptcy filing would be widespread , federal regulators appear little concerned that it could inflict significant damage to the u . s . economy . ( see related article on page al 0 . )
the scale of the enron collapse is huge , experts say . "" there is nothing to compare it to , "" said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy specialist with coudert brothers in new york . "" the business was so large . there were so many different kinds of operating entities under the enron umbrella . ""
in a way , he added , a filing would represent all the challenges of two of the biggest bankruptcies in recent years - - this past spring ' s chapter 11 filing by pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric utility unit , and the demise of drexel burnham lambert , the wall street securities firm that failed more than a decade ago . a filing by enron , with about $ 13 billion in debt , would rank among the largest bankruptcy filings ever .
bankruptcy lawyers and creditors ' rights specialists , already swamped with a wealth of work from a boom in chapter 11 filings during the last 18 months , said they had been contacted by worried banks and other lenders to enron , seeking to retain them in the event of a chapter 11 filing . enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company is exploring its options and wouldn ' t comment on whether it has retained bankruptcy counsel .
but lawyers said the company was already in discussions about retaining its own counsel . among the likely advisers is new york law firm weil gotshal the idea is to protect all parties from market risk as the value of those contracts can fluctuate from day to day , and to avoid a larger financial meltdown .
that means enron ' s counterparties are free to close out such transactions , rather than file claims in a bankruptcy proceeding reflecting the total notional amount of any trades . in other words , a securities firm that is a counterparty to enron in many financial contracts would tally up how much it owes enron under such contracts and how much enron owes it , offsetting the amounts against each other . but this process is ripe for conflicts , as disputes easily could arise over the value of the contracts .
"" it is an incredibly complex piece of financial engineering , "" andrew rahl , a bankruptcy lawyer at anderson kill & olick in new york , said of the process .
how much collateral those counterparties could seize isn ' t at all clear , either . enron was considered very aggressive in negotiating agreements such as swaps , where a party trades an obligation to pay a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate on given securities . the speed with which the company ' s finances have deteriorated further reduces the odds that its trading partners will be able to get paid anytime soon . without any security , counterparty claims would go into the probably massive general pool of claims from unsecured creditors .
besides banks and bondholders , dozens of companies , municipalities and utilities that had signed multiyear power contracts with enron may be left in the lurch . over the years , the likes of retailer j . c . penney co . , and shopping - mall company simon property group , of indianapolis , signed on with enron , as it undercut local utilities in newly deregulated markets .
any bankruptcy also is likely to trigger collateral lawsuits , as aggrieved parties look for alternative deep pockets . one possible target , analysts said , could be advisers that helped enron establish off - balance - sheet vehicles and other debt related to troubled investment partnerships , which have triggered massive losses in recent weeks . moreover , enron directors themselves could be vulnerable , too .
yesterday , enron named raymond s . troubh , a new york financial consultant , to its board as chairman of a newly formed special litigation committee to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits .
at the same time , any filing would give enron some advantages , most notably greater ease in securing financing . this is because once companies file for protection , any new cash infusion from the banks has an overriding claim on any of the company ' s assets , at the expense of previous lenders .
in addition , potential buyers for enron businesses may be more likely to emerge once the company is operating with court protection and the depth of its problems are known .
"" there is a certain comfort level that buyers have when buying a business in a chapter 11 case that doesn ' t exist when a company is struggling outside of bankruptcy , "" said keith shapiro , a bankruptcy lawyer at greenberg traurig in chicago .

credit markets
why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - s & p cries ` junk , ' but the warning comes too late
by gregory zuckerman and jathon sapsford
staff reporters of the wall street journal
11 / 29 / 2001

cl

at 10 : 57 a . m . est yesterday , an announcement came out that effectively scuttled dynegy inc . ' s proposed takeover of enron corp . it was issued not by the two companies or their bankers , but by a behind - the - scenes player that was pivotal in the deal from the start .
the news came from standard & poor ' s , which lowered enron ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status , because of concern about the energy trading company ' s financial condition . the move , followed by similar downgrades by moody ' s investors service inc . and fitch inc . several hours later , prompted dynegy to announce that it was walking away from the multibillion dollar deal .
the downgrades highlight the key role that credit - rating agencies - - which are sometimes only bit players - - are having in one of the biggest wall street dramas in years . before they became deal breakers , the ratings agencies had emerged as unlikely deal makers just a few weeks ago , by leaving enron little choice but to seek a merger partner or face a downgrade that would have made it difficult to keep running its business .
throughout the enron saga , the rating agencies found themselves the target of repeated and intense lobbying by enron , dynegy and their bankers at j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . all tried - - and ultimately failed - - to come up with assurances that the merger would bolster enron and thus protect bondholders and lenders from suffering losses .
the dramatic downgrades are sure to increase scrutiny over the role of the rating agencies in the enron situation . critics say that , in waiting until enron ' s bonds already had plummeted in value , the ratings agencies failed in their job of anticipating a company ' s financial problems and giving investors an early warning .
it now seems clear that the rating agencies , like most securities analysts , seem to have too easily accepted enron ' s murky financial reporting , which gave the impression that the company ' s balance sheet was stronger than it was . as recently as late october , both moody ' s corp . ' s moody ' s and mcgraw - hill cos . ' s & p had a solid investment - grade rating on enron ' s debt .
but since credit - rating agencies often have access to company information that securities analysts often don ' t have , the rating agencies could take some heat for not anticipating the financial difficulties . bond investors , for instance , say s & p was prematurely upbeat about enron ' s outlook earlier this month , and long ago should have demanded more information from the company . "" if the rating agencies were privy all along to information that , as near as i can tell , was nonpublic regarding these off - balance - sheet liabilities , then their judgment looks even more faulty , "" says carol levenson of gimme credit , a chicago - based analyst .
others wonder whether the ratings executives should have lowered the rating to junk days ago , when enron ' s problems became obvious . while such a move would have crippled the company ' s ability to find a suitor , holding off on the ratings move hurt stock and bond investors left holding the securities .
"" i don ' t think the consequences of a rating action should have anything to do with whether one takes that rating action or not , if one feels it ' s warranted , "" ms . levenson says . "" i don ' t think there was any doubt enron was a junk credit . ""
the ratings agencies counter that enron ' s financial condition , while weakened , became precarious only in the past few days , and given the consequences of a downgrade they needed to be prudent .
indeed , every party to the deal - - until yesterday - - kept working to provide financial infusions to enron to keep the deal alive . enron executives were particularly desperate to hold off a ratings downgrade . once the debt was lowered to junk status from investment grade , a whopping $ 3 . 9 billion of debt immediately became due , jeopardizing enron ' s ability to stay afloat .
worries about such a debt downgrade weeks ago pushed enron into the merger with dynegy , despite reservations from some enron executives about whether the deal was right . enron pledged some of its best assets to secure a $ 500 million investment from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup ' s citibank , and agreed to strict terms demanded by banks to get an emergency $ 1 billion credit line from various banks . in recent days , the two companies worked to restructure their merger and to raise still more liquidity for enron .
by 4 p . m . tuesday , the credit agencies agreed to hold off on a downgrade , convinced the two sides were making progress in restructuring the deal and drumming up new money for enron . in a conference call , ron barone , a managing director at s & p , told enron executives he was willing to wait on a decision , aware of the serious consequences of a downgrade .
"" we ' ll be very patient and diligent "" because of the progress being made , he told them , according to someone familiar with the conversation .
as late as 10 : 30 p . m . tuesday , a new deal still seemed in sight . but at about 2 a . m . yesterday , the talks broke down . instead of being briefed about terms of a new merger agreement , the credit - agency executives became doubtful a resolution would ever be reached .
in a late morning phone call to jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , mr . barone broke the news that the company ' s credit would be downgraded . "" we lost confidence the deal would be consummated in a way that would keep the rating intact , "" mr . barone says in an interview . "" enron ' s credibility and viability continued to diminish . they were aware of our concerns . ""
s & p downgraded enron ' s corporate - credit rating two full grades to single - b - minus , near the lower end of the junk - bond world , from triple - b - minus , the lowest investment - grade level . moody ' s lowered the debt to b 2 from baa 3 .
in a late - afternoon conference call with investors , s & p executives said the rating could still be lowered further , on the heels of the official announcement that the merger with dynegy was off .
responding to criticism that the credit agencies should have downgraded enron ' s debt sooner , mr . barone of s & p notes that the rating agency wasn ' t "" privy to everything . "" still , he adds , until yesterday "" we were confident it was an investment - grade company , and that the merger would give it the security to enable enron to function at an investment - grade level . ""
on the flip side , of course , if enron is forced into bankruptcy , the rating agencies may well catch heat that their impact was too drastic , effectively killing the deal .
treasurys
treasurys ended slightly higher . at 4 p . m . , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 1 / 32 point , or 31 cents per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 15 / 32 to yield 4 . 938 % . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price also was up 1 / 32 point , at 100 9 / 32 to yield 5 . 355 % .
the dow jones industrial average ended with a loss of 160 . 74 points . investors often shift funds to the relative safety of the government securities market at times when stocks are weak . a treasury sale of $ 21 billion of two - year notes drew less demand than expected . the bid - to - cover ratio , a gauge of demand comparing the dollar value of bids received with those awarded , was 1 . 51 , well below the 2 . 53 average of the past 12 auctions .
also somewhat bearish for the bond market was release of the fed ' s beige book report , an assessment of economic conditions around the country in advance of policy meetings . policy makers are to meet again dec . 11 .
although the report cited weakness in the economy , it didn ' t encourage people in the bond market to expect further rate cuts by the fed , analysts said . "" not everybody is in the camp that the fed ' s going to ease again , "" said kevin flanagan , market strategist at morgan stanley .

why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - energy trading bears the brunt of enron woes

less than a month ago , enron corp . ' s electronic trading system was the largest of its kind in the world , accounting for a quarter of all the natural gas and electricity delivered in the u . s .
yesterday , the system was shut down , a victim of enron ' s failed deal with dynegy inc .
while the rise and sudden fall of enron rippled throughout financial markets yesterday , nowhere was it more immediately evident than in energy trading , an arena utterly transformed by enron in recent years .
since the late 1990 s , enrononline had established itself as the dominant electronic energy marketplace - - and major competitor of the traditional futures exchanges - - as it grew to handle an average of 5 , 400 trades a day , with a value of about $ 2 . 8 billion .
but a flight away from enron began weeks ago , as initial news of the company ' s woes began to spread . because enron itself guaranteed trades on its platform , fears grew that the company might not be able to complete many of the transactions .
the exodus of trading activity from enrononline accelerated throughout the day yesterday , culminating in the system ' s shutdown around midday , when quotes on the system ' s internet trading screens simply went blank .
by 3 : 30 p . m . est , some trading had resumed in natural gas , though spokesman eric thode declined to say whether enron ' s markets would be open today . "" that ' s part of an evaluation that ' s ongoing , "" he said .
on the floor of the new york mercantile exchange , a traditional floor - based futures market , natural - gas trading volume almost doubled yesterday to 116 , 000 contracts . while enron ' s woes were the main driver behind the surge , the market also reacted to important storage data from the american gas association .
natural - gas prices jumped about 25 cents yesterday morning on an initial reaction to the enron news , near $ 3 per million british thermal units , then slipped back as the aga announced that gas storage had grown by 16 billion cubic feet to an all - time high . the nearby december contract fell 29 cents to $ 2 . 315 per million btus .
"" anyone who jumped into the gas market on the enron news is praying right now [ that prices recover ] , "" guy gleichmann , senior energy trader at barkely financial . "" it should only be a short - term factor in the market . ""
he said enron ' s collapse has helped gas prices because it is mainly seen as a threat to the overall gas supply . traders assume enrononline ' s problems won ' t affect actual energy deliveries , because whoever takes over enron ' s assets is expected to honor those commitments .
meantime , anticipating potential fallout from the enron problems , energy firms also have been reducing their financial risk in the energy markets by unwinding complex derivatives bets , either by hedging against them or taking delivery of the physical commodity .
in the future , those firms are likely to favor straightforward cash transactions for energy as a result of the enron meltdown . "" if anything , the enron situation has really simplified this market , "" mr . gleichmann said .
yesterday on the , enron ' s primary electronic rival , traders waited up to five minutes to log in , said jeff sprecher , the online market ' s chief executive .
he said it seemed most traders were just jockeying for position at first , assessing the newfound risk before actually making any trades . within the first 15 minutes after standard & poor ' s initial downgrade of enron , mr . sprecher said , the number of bids and offers on dropped by almost a third , to 2 , 200 .
"" by the end of the day , though , we expect this will probably be a record day for us , "" said mr . sprecher , who estimated the system ' s overall volume is up 45 % this month .
he expects much of that gain to be permanent on ice , although he cautioned that a loss of enrononline from the marketplace would have a downside , since its presence created opportunities to trade spreads between the two platforms .
nymex president j . robert collins warned it is still too early to declare enrononline dead . but he said its difficulties bode well for his exchange ' s internet - based system , dubbed enymex , now in development .
"" because of credit issues involving enron , companies might be more hesitant to trade there , "" he said . "" so we have a better shot with enymex than we did three or four months ago . ""
ronald j . barone , managing director for energy research at ubs warburg , said enrononline ' s value to prospective acquirers will drop quickly in coming days , if the business continues to decline .
"" dynegy really liked enrononline , but look at how much business the platform ' s been losing , "" said mr . barone , who downgraded enron ' s stock yesterday to a hold . "" there ' s also a question of how many more skeletons there are in the closet . ""
in commodity trading yesterday :
grains : futures prices on corn , wheat and soybeans all fell again at the chicago board of trade as what was described as a technical - based selloff accelerated . december - delivery corn futures sank to $ 1 . 9850 a bushel late in the session , which wiped out the old contract low . the contract ended up settling down five cents at $ 1 . 9875 a bushel .
crude oil : crude - oil futures slipped 26 cents to $ 19 . 22 a barrel after weekly inventory data showed a larger - than - expected five - million - barrel build in distillates supplies , which include heating oil . high refinery runs and imports were behind the build , analysts said . the contract might have fallen even more , except for a modest drop reported for crude - oil stocks .

for years , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay has been george w . bush ' s best friend in the board rooms of america ' s top corporations .
since 1993 , mr . lay and enron have donated nearly $ 2 million to mr . bush ' s political career , making them mr . bush ' s biggest backers . when mr . bush was texas governor , mr . lay , a houston resident , helped him win passage of a state education - reform plan that brought mr . bush national acclaim . during that fight , mr . lay got to know aides who became power players in the bush white house .
mr . lay was confident enough of his friendship with mr . bush that he even needled him for needing arthroscopic surgery to repair a jogging injury . "" i want you to know that at least one jogger [ me ] got past 50 without that surgery , "" mr . lay scribbled in a note to then governor in 1997 .
still , as enron faces its greatest crisis , mr . lay ' s influence and personal relationships with the administration have amounted to little . there appears to be no effort by the white house or congress to bail enron out of its difficulties , which are widely seen as self - inflicted . the white house had no comment on mr . lay ' s predicament , a spokeswoman said . indeed , short of an actual bailout to help enron meet its obligations - - such as an aid package approved by congress or organized by government officials from private sources , similar to the rescue of the long term capital management hedge fund - - there is little washington can do at this stage to help the company . nor is there likely to be a bailout , since enron has burned many bridges on capitol hill with its history of strong - arm lobbying tactics , some congressional aides say .
that may reassure a cynical public , says robert mosbacher , commerce secretary in the first bush administration and a longtime friend of the current president as well as mr . lay . "" i don ' t see anybody being let off the hook , "" he said .
mr . mosbacher says he introduced mr . lay to the bush family around 1987 , when he persuaded mr . lay to help raise money for george h . w . bush ' s successful presidential bid in 1988 . mr . lay contributed $ 461 , 000 to the younger mr . bush ' s two successful gubernatorial campaigns . he also made enron ' s fleet of corporate jets available to mr . bush and won his help in lobbying officials in other states considering enron projects .
his influence with then - gov . bush was based on more than money . mr . lay was one of the state ' s leading business executives and deeply involved in texas politics . under mr . bush ' s predecessor , democrat ann richards , mr . lay headed the governor ' s business council , a state advisory board . mr . bush asked him to stay on the job to help develop an educational reform plan and sell it to the texas legislature .
in that capacity , mr . lay became close to several bush aides , including political guru karl rove and communications adviser karen hughes , who have taken positions at the white house . he also got to know another leading texas businessman : dick cheney , then ceo of dallas oil concern halliburton co . , who would become mr . bush ' s pick for vice president .
against this backdrop , mr . lay was widely considered a top candidate for treasury secretary in the younger bush ' s administration . ultimately though , he was disqualified , bush insiders say , as too closely identified with mr . bush , mr . cheney and others who worked in the texas energy business for an administration that wanted to show it wasn ' t in the pocket of big oil companies .
early on , mr . lay had unrivaled access to the administration . when the president ' s advisers debated a new energy policy in the spring , mr . lay was the only energy executive to be invited for a one - on - one session with mr . cheney , who led the effort . mr . lay also worked with mr . rove and others to successfully push for appointments to the federal energy regulatory commission , which oversees much of enron ' s business .
as enron ' s problems multiplied and its fortunes plummeted , however , the white house was silent . during a several - hour long interview in the spring , mr . lay mused that his bush connections could boomerang someday . "" it could hurt , from the standpoint that , at some point , they lean in the other direction to make sure they don ' t face criticism , "" he said .

dynegy and chevrontexaco slide along with plunge in enron stock

new york - - the collapse of enron dominated stock trading yesterday , as a host of the power generators and energy merchants exposed to the firm tumbled .
shares of dynegy , the suitor for enron that pulled out of a deal after debt - rating agencies lowered their ratings on enron ' s bonds , fell 4 . 92 , or 12 % , to 35 . 97 . chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , slid 1 . 07 , or 1 . 2 % , to 84 . 55 .
shares of enron itself were ground down more than 85 % . the loss of $ 3 . 50 brought the closing price of each enron share down to 61 cents . this from a stock that , as recently as august 2000 , commanded more than $ 90 a share .
a host of other energy merchants , such as el paso , which lost 3 . 59 , or 7 . 4 % , to 44 . 91 , williams , which shed 1 . 80 , or 6 . 2 % , to 27 . 05 , and american electric power , which fell 2 . 03 , or 4 . 8 % , to 40 . 44 , all got caught in the backlash against the energy market .
the dow jones utility average finished the session down 8 . 48 points , a drop of 2 . 94 % , to 279 . 95 , which brought it down to a 52 - week low .
shares of two giant financial - services providers also got caught by their exposure to enron , and paid the price . shares of citigroup fell 2 . 75 , or 5 . 4 % , to 47 . 80 , while j . p . morgan chase slid 2 . 30 , or 5 . 8 % , to 37 . 50 .
with those two components in decline , the dow jones industrial average finished the session 160 . 74 points lower , a loss of 1 . 63 % , to 9711 . 86 . the nasdaq composite slid 2 . 48 % , or 48 points , to 1887 . 97 .
the dow industrial average ' s finish at 9711 . 86 represented the lowest close the average has posted in more than two weeks , since ending at 9554 . 37 . traders insisted that the speed and apparent ease with which market averages have managed to lard on gains over the past several weeks has stretched valuations , and left equities vulnerable to events , like the enron sell - off , that a sturdier market might have more handily absorbed .
"" one of the most important overriding factors has been the performance of the market itself , "" arthur hogan , chief market analyst at jefferies , said . "" the market has moved straight up seven weeks in a row , and when it moves up in a straight line like that , it doesn ' t take much in the way of a catalyst to tip it over . ""
whether it was excuse - making or profit - taking , the market did have to absorb some fundamental challenges in the session , including an especially pessimistic assessment of economic conditions from the federal reserve . the central bank released its beige book report on economic conditions , which showed , overall , the economy tilted more toward further slowing than it did toward recovery .
that helped further puncture shares of some of the retailers that got waylaid in tuesday ' s trading by a bearish consumer sentiment reading . shares of gap , stung by a reduction in its investment rating by prudential securities , lost 79 cents , or 5 . 5 % , to 13 . 61 . shares of another apparel retailer , american eagle outfitters , lost 1 . 3 , or 5 . 9 % , to 24 . 40 , while talbots dropped 1 . 25 , or 3 . 6 % , to 33 , and discounter kohl ' s fell 84 cents , or 1 . 2 % , to 67 . 86 .
meanwhile , some of the classic cyclical stocks that have had good runs over the past several weeks as investors bet on an eventual economic recovery gave ground . shares of boeing fell 1 . 33 , or 3 . 7 % , to 34 . 17 , after j . p . morgan reduced its earnings forecasts for 2002 and 2003 . whirlpool lost 1 . 12 , or 1 . 7 % , to 64 . 98 . auto - parts maker eaton declined 1 , or 1 . 4 % , to 69 . 60 . general electric , also subject to some downbeat comments from j . p . morgan , fell 1 . 72 , or 39 . 35 .
continental airlines lost 2 . 40 , or 10 % , to 21 . 70 . the air carrier completed a public offering of 6 . 74 million shares of stock priced at $ 22 . 50 , a discount to tuesday ' s closing price of 24 . 10 .
coca - cola declined 1 . 06 , or 2 . 2 % , to 46 . 75 . j . p . morgan said it expects slower volume growth ahead for the beverage maker ' s bottlers . shares of coca - cola enterprises , coke ' s biggest bottler , eased 40 cents , or 2 . 3 % , to 17 .
magna international rose 1 . 54 , or 2 . 6 % , to 61 . 51 . salomon smith barney started coverage of the canadian auto - components maker with a buy rating .
medtronic gained 1 . 74 , or 4 % , to 45 . 78 . the minneapolis medical - device maker reported fiscal second - quarter results that matched wall street ' s projections , and said it expected to live up to third - quarter forecasts .
foot locker eased 19 cents , or 1 . 2 % , to 15 . 70 , after mixed views from rival brokers . rbc capital markets started coverage of the stock with a strong buy rating , but jefferies reduced its coverage of the stock to accumulate from buy .

dollar declines against yen and euro amid growing doubts on u . s . economy

new york - - growing doubts about the u . s . economy ' s ability to rebound quickly from recession weighed heavily on the dollar , pushing the currency down almost a full yen and helping the euro regain some lost ground .
weakness in u . s . stocks - - due partly to news that dynegy inc . decided to walk away from its deal to buy enron corp . - - also put pressure on the dollar , while enron ' s debt woes added to general skittishness about the ability of u . s . business to bounce back quickly .
"" we know there are companies out there in trouble , "" said lara rhame , economist at brown brothers harriman in new york , who said that while the enron developments weren ' t having a direct impact on foreign - exchange markets , such reports do "" limit the kind of superdollar that we saw back in 1999 . ""
the dollar selloff kicked off in asian trading , when dealers used a standard & poor ' s downgrade of japan ' s sovereign rating as an excuse to buy the yen . the downgrade to double - a from double - a - plus was better than the market ' s expectations of a two - notch downgrade , rendering it good news of sorts .
the selling continued in new york trading , as traders continued to price in the possibility that they may have been far too optimistic about the dollar .
the two - pronged catalyst for this change of heart was the weak november consumer confidence index released tuesday , and subsequent gloomy comments from federal reserve governor laurence meyer pointing to more downside risks to the economy . the release of the federal reserve ' s beige book report yesterday served only to flame this pessimism .
the fed said that further slowing outweighed signs of recovery for the u . s . economy this autumn , noting that economic activity generally remained soft in october and the first half of november .
"" people wanted greater signs of recovery than they got from the fed , "" said alan ruskin , research director at the 4 cast financial consultancy in new york .
the beige book , a summary of economic activity prepared for use at the central bank ' s next federal open market committee meeting dec . 11 , is widely viewed as an indicator of future monetary policy decisions and the report helped to solidify expectations of a rate cut of at least a quarter percentage point .
late yesterday in new york , the euro was at 88 . 84 u . s . cents , its high for the session and up from 88 . 34 cents late tuesday in new york . the dollar was at 123 . 11 yen - - around its intraday low - - and almost a full yen down from 123 . 96 yen late tuesday in new york . the dollar was also at 1 . 6460 swiss francs , down from 1 . 6484 francs in london and 1 . 6560 francs tuesday . sterling was at $ 1 . 4261 , up from $ 1 . 4185 earlier in london and $ 1 . 4153 late tuesday .
elsewhere , the canadian dollar climbed to its highest levels in almost a month , confounding the view that bad news for the u . s . is bad news for canada .
the canadian currency has tended to suffer from an association with the u . s . , given that 85 % of canada ' s exports head south of the border . however , a 0 . 50 - percentage - point rate cut by the bank of canada on tuesday was quickly followed by the gloomy consumer confidence report in the u . s . , which undercut faith in the dollar and appeared to give the canadian unit just the opportunity it was seeking .
late in the new york day , the u . s . dollar was at c $ 1 . 5842 , down from c $ 1 . 5939 late tuesday .

houston - - enron corp . , the subject of four lawsuits filed over losses in its employees ' 401 ( k ) retirement plan , is asking laid - off workers to waive legal claims against it in exchange for some of their severance payments .
attorneys for some of the employees sought to block that requirement . plaintiffs are seeking an "" immediate preliminary injunction prohibiting enron from soliciting any releases which would affect the participants ' rights vis a vis the plan , "" according to an amended complaint filed by seattle firm campbell harrison & wright .

enron , the champion of energy deregulation that grew into one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , collapsed yesterday , after a rival backed out of a deal to buy it and many big trading partners stopped doing business with it .
enron , based in houston , was widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection . with $ 62 billion in assets as of sept . 30 , it would be the biggest american company ever to go bankrupt , dwarfing the filing by texaco in 1987 . late in the day , though , enron ' s chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said that the company was still talking to banks about a restructuring and considering other options .
talks with its would - be rescuer dynegy , also of houston , about salvaging the deal ended in acrimony .
dynegy , which had agreed on nov . 9 to buy enron but had second thoughts as enron disclosed more financial problems and investors pummeled its stock , accused enron of misrepresenting the health of its business . enron , meanwhile , was weighing whether to sue dynegy for breaching the terms of the deal , a person close to enron said .
enron ' s swift collapse left the prospects of 21 , 000 employees in doubt and wiped out what was left of the holdings of stock investors , including some big mutual funds , as shares that sold for $ 90 in august 2000 crashed to close yesterday at 61 cents . it roiled the treasury market and tarnished the standing of the big new york banks that both advised on the deal and poured their own cash into the company . and it left in tatters the reputation of enron ' s chief executive , kenneth l . lay , a confidant and campaign backer of president george w . bush . [ page cl . ]
the treasury department , the federal reserve and the federal energy regulatory commission said they had monitored enron ' s impact on the financial and energy markets yesterday ; officials who would comment said they saw no dangerous ripple effect .
' ' the markets are functioning normally , ' ' said peter bakstansky , a spokesman for the federal reserve bank of new york .
from a pipeline company in the 1980 ' s , enron grew into the world ' s largest energy trader , using the internet to buy and sell natural gas and electric power supplies for utilities and industrial power users and helping them hedge against fluctuations in power prices .
but enron was undone by shaky accounting , too much borrowed money and an unwillingness to provide information to investors who grew to doubt its financial reports .
five weeks ago , the company disclosed that , to fuel its growth , it had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its balance sheet and into an array of complex partnerships . the securities and exchange commission began an investigation , and enron restated five years of earnings , wiping out nearly $ 600 million in profit .
enron was teetering close to insolvency before dynegy , a smaller cross - town rival , agreed to acquire it for $ 9 billion plus the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt , with additional financing from chevrontexaco , a major dynegy shareholder .
but enron subsequently disclosed even more debts , and its financial plight continued to worsen . energy - trading companies reduced dealings with the firm ; doubting its creditworthiness , some forced enron to pay higher prices for natural gas and other products or required it to post large cash deposits to back trades .
for four days , enron and dynegy worked to salvage the deal . but yesterday morning , dynegy pulled out . ' ' we knew when to say no , and this morning , we said no , ' ' said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman .
in an interview , mr . watson said enron ' s energy - trading business had deteriorated . he also cited ' ' surprises ' ' in the quarterly report to the s . e . c . that enron filed on nov . 19 , including the disclosures that a credit downgrade meant enron had to pay or refinance a $ 690 million obligation and that enron had less cash on hand than dynegy had expected . ' ' confidence and credibility , which is what this business is all about , deteriorated after that , ' ' he said .
mr . watson said he called mr . lay yesterday after a meeting of dynegy ' s board to call off the deal . by then , s . dynegy shares fell $ 4 . 08 , or 10 percent , to close at $ 36 . 81 .
other big energy traders , like the el paso corporation , reliant energy , mirant and aquila , also fell . but enron ' s gradual decline over the last month gave many energy companies time to reduce their exposure to enron , and many operate rival trading operations that would benefit from its collapse .
yesterday morning , as news leaked out of dynegy ' s plans to cancel the deal and s . prices soar . dec . 15 2000 : four months after the chief executive of azurix resigns , enron takes the company private again . aug . 14 , 2001 : only six months after becoming chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling resigns . he is succeeded by kenneth l . lay . oct . 8 : four years after buying portland general electric , enron agrees to sell it to northwest natural gas oct . 16 : enron reports a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million . oct . 24 : two days after enron discloses that the securities and exchange commission is looking into complicated transactions involving enron and partnerships set up by andrew s . fastow , the company ' s chief financial officer , mr . fastow is forced out . oct . 31 : the s . e . c . upgrades its inquiry to a formal investigation . nov . 8 : enron discloses that it overstated profits for the previous five years by $ 586 million . nov . 9 : dynegy agrees to buy enron for about $ 9 billion . yesterday : the merger collapses . enron ' s stock falls $ 3 . 50 to 61 cents .

enron ' s collapse : the last resort
a bankruptcy filing might be the best remaining choice

enron , facing the collapse of a deal with dynegy that might have rescued it from disaster and a tidal wave of debts suddenly coming due , may now have little choice but to enter bankruptcy , lawyers and analysts said yesterday .
filing for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code would give the company some much - needed breathing room to deal with creditors ' claims , as well as afford any eventual buyer the advantage of a court ' s approval .
but bankruptcy would also be complicated by the fact that some of enron ' s most valuable assets , including its transwestern pipeline linking texas natural gas fields with california energy markets , are already pledged to lenders . the value of other assets available to satisfy unsecured creditors is unclear .
still , enron ' s creditors will not necessarily lose everything , said robert j . rosenberg , a lawyer at latham any awards would not be paid until after creditors were satisfied . and like enron ' s other shareholders , they might end up with nothing , said robert d . albergotti , a partner at haynes & boone , a dallas law firm .
if enron files for bankruptcy , this is not likely to prevent litigation against arthur andersen , the company ' s outside auditor , said jeffrey n . gordon of columbia university law school . indeed , bankruptcy proceedings could give both the company and investors an opportunity to figure out exactly how its profits came to be overstated and to look for potential fraud .
a special committee of enron ' s board has already retained deloitte & touche , another big accounting firm , to help .
' ' it ' s going to be a while before they figure it all out , ' ' professor gordon said .

an implosion on wall street

enron , the energy - trading company , may be on the verge of extinction with the collapse yesterday of its proposed acquisition by dynegy , a smaller competitor , and the downgrading of its debt to junk status . but its name has attained immortality on wall street .
enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm . take a high - flying company terribly impressed with its sense of unique mission and ingenuity , and correspondingly contemptuous of its obligations to fully comply with the spirit of accounting rules . then add fawning investors , wall street analysts , journalists and accountants unwilling to allow a company ' s lack of transparency about its business to get in the way of a dizzying ride , until they realize the destination is the top of a steep cliff . what you have then is an enron .
there have been plenty of other once - unfathomable implosions on wall street , but perhaps none so sudden or of such magnitude . jittery financial markets now have to contend with the possibility that an enron bankruptcy could undermine the financial health of banks and other energy companies . enron ranked seventh on the list of fortune 500 companies last year , and remained one of the most hyped stories on wall street well into this year . a pioneer in creating private marketplaces for newly deregulated commodities , enron was touted as a revolutionary force , bridging the dot - com world and stodgy energy markets .
now enron may become one of the largest bankruptcy cases in history . its stock closed yesterday at 61 cents , as investors rushed for the exits in reaction to the fatal news that , without a bailout from dynegy , enron is unlikely to be able to meet its crushing debt obligations .
the company ' s autopsy will be a complicated affair , entailing numerous lawsuits . what is already clear , and will come as a shock to millions of trusting individual investors across america , is that the financials of a fortune 500 company were essentially a mystery . enron ' s death watch began last month when it grudgingly disclosed that $ 1 . 2 billion of its market value had vanished as a result of ' ' related - party ' ' transactions with private partnerships that enriched company insiders . then enron admitted that it had overstated its profits over the last five years by $ 600 million . dynegy cited enron ' s lack of forthrightness as a reason to walk away from the merger agreement .
not very long ago , competitors and democrats in washington were worrying whether the close ties between enron ' s chairman , kenneth lay , and george w . bush would give the company too much influence . enron has aggressively lobbied , with some success in recent years , to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations .
now enron is the best argument for the need for stronger supervision of public companies ' financial data . the securities and exchange commission should make sure that the energy trader ' s saga puts an end to any talk of lessening disclosure requirements faced by public companies . moreover , arthur andersen ' s failure to uncover flawed accounting by enron , or to forcefully question some of the company ' s shadier transactions , raises serious concerns about auditors ' commitment to be sufficiently diligent in reviewing the actions of major companies .
there is a certain irony that enron , a champion of deregulation , now becomes a poster child for the need for strong regulation on wall street .

enron ' s collapse : the lenders
citigroup and j . p . morgan are left with bruised egos and exposure to loans

dynegy ' s decision to walk away from enron leaves citigroup and j . p . morgan chase licking their wounds after an effort to burnish their reputations as deal makers .
as lead advisers and lead bankers for enron , the banks had the chance to build influence in the merger business . unlike other wall street firms , citigroup and j . p . morgan have large balance sheets and have boasted of their ability to provide both loans and advice . j . p . morgan , in particular , ' ' has been saying that providing financing is an advantage they have in terms of building their investment banking franchise , ' ' said richard strauss , a goldman , sachs analyst following brokerage firms .
now , not only have the banks lost bragging rights for pulling off a difficult deal , as well as millions in fees , they are also left holding hundreds of millions in loans to enron , which is trying to stave off bankruptcy . enron owes the two banks anywhere from $ 800 million to $ 900 million each , although some of it may be hedged through derivatives contracts , analysts estimated .
in bankruptcy , of course , creditors come well ahead of shareholders , who have now been virtually wiped out . janus capital was the biggest shareholder for most of the year , but alliance capital surpassed it as of sept . 30 , according to the latest regulatory filing available . enron ' s stock plunged to 61 cents yesterday .
worries about the money enron owes the banks punished their stocks yesterday . citigroup ' s shares closed at $ 47 . 80 each , down $ 2 . 75 , while j . p . morgan fell $ 2 . 30 , to $ 37 . 50 .
even if enron files for bankruptcy , neither j . p . morgan nor citigroup is thought to have enough exposure to be at serious risk . executives of the banks declined to comment on the estimates of their exposure . while the banks had each promised to make equity investments in the companies of $ 250 million each , those investments have been canceled along with the dynegy deal .
about half of the money owed to j . p . morgan and citigroup consists of a $ 1 billion loan the banks made earlier this month that is secured by one of enron ' s pipelines . citigroup lent $ 600 million , and j . p . morgan provided the rest , according to an executive close to the enron negotiations . the remainder owed to the banks is in various loans , trading positions and other investments not secured by enron assets .
given that there are assets backing much of the banks ' loans , some analysts said the stock market had overreacted . ' ' the net exposure could be very small , ' ' said andrew collins , who covers bank stocks at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray and is recommending citigroup and j . p . morgan .
jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , said the company was still working with j . p . morgan chase and citigroup to restructure enron ' s debts .
several other banks may own large amounts of enron debt . bank of america has $ 200 million to $ 300 million , according to estimates by lori appelbaum , who follows bank stocks for goldman , sachs , and ruchi madan , a stock analyst at salomon smith barney . other banks identified by the analysts as owed money are the bank of new york , bank one , fleetboston financial , suntrust and the wachovia corporation . a spokesman for suntrust did not return calls ; executives at the other banks declined to comment .
in what appears to have been bad timing , alliance capital management , a subsidiary of axa , increased its stake in enron late this summer . janus , a unit of stilwell financial , had been the biggest shareholder , but was pruning its stake . alliance ' s position grew 71 percent in the report filed in september , to 5 . 8 percent of enron ' s outstanding . jane ingalls , a spokeswoman for janus , said last night that janus had since sold all its shares , but did not say when or at what price . a spokesman for alliance would not comment about its stake in enron .

enron ' s collapse : the market
in turbulent bond market , enron ' s woes exacerbate turmoil
by gretchen morgenson

the swift downfall of enron has contributed to extreme turbulence in the united states treasury market in recent weeks , causing violent swings in interest rates not seen since russia defaulted on its debt and the long - term capital management hedge fund nearly collapsed in late 1998 .
even though the exact makeup of enron ' s large trading portfolio remains a mystery , traders said that the energy company had bet that interest rates would continue to decline because of continuing weakness in the economy .
then two weeks ago , the economy began to show signs of revival . as investors decided that the days of federal reserve rate cuts were over , rates began to rise and prices on treasury securities fell . the move out of treasuries crushed traders who still expected the weak economy to push interest rates lower . scrambling to cut their losses , those traders sold even more , depressing prices and pushing up rates further .
the sense among many market participants is that enron ' s woes made a bad market excruciating . ' ' i think the street in general lost half of its year or more in the last week or two , ' ' said stan jonas , managing director at fimat usa , a broker dealer . ' ' everyone was long the bond market , thinking the economy was going to be bad . then everything shifted , and enron drove it to extremes . ' '
how extreme ? in the two weeks beginning nov . 12 , two - year treasury notes plummeted in price , pushing their yields up to 3 . 18 percent , from 2 . 41 percent . in the same period , yields on treasuries with five - year maturities went to 4 . 4 percent , from 3 . 62 percent .
the trade that appears to have gone awry for enron , market participants say , involved the sale of hundreds of thousands of eurodollar futures , some of which matured in two or three years . such contracts are frequently used to bet on the direction of interest rates . enron could also have used the eurodollar contracts to hedge against fluctuations in oil prices . in a weak economy , oil prices usually fall . but so do interest rates , so a bet on lower rates would produce gains to help offset the decline in oil prices . when data showed signs of life in the economy , traders surmised that enron began to sell its eurodollars and started an avalanche of selling among other traders .
there were huge eurodollar positions being liquidated , said gemma wright , director of market strategy at barclays capital . ' ' we don ' t know for certain who it was , but the amount of the loss was high . ' '
one reason that traders suspect enron may have been forced out of such a position was that the company had neither the cash flow nor the bank credit to meet calls for additional cash from traders at other firms . typically , companies have cash reserves to meet such calls or have access to temporary lines of credit to cover shortfalls . enron appears to have neither . yesterday , the company said it was suspending all payments except for those ' ' necessary to maintain core operations . ' '
in addition to the recent interest rate spike , enron has had to contend with falling oil prices . the price of crude oil has dropped 28 percent since the end of october .
caught in a vise , enron has almost certainly been selling securities to raise cash . treasury securities and eurodollar contracts , because their markets are large , are among the easiest to sell . in both cases , enron was probably selling into a falling market .
adding to the turmoil in the bond market , traders said , was less participation by wall street firms , which were unwilling to take on big new trading positions near the end of their fiscal year . several firms end their years on nov . 30 .
some traders say enron ' s problems started with comments on tuesday by laurence h . meyer , a governor of the federal reserve . mr . meyer suggested that additional rate cuts might be coming , and that remark helped stabilize prices of treasury securities . ' ' it ' s my view that there are no coincidences , ' ' mr . jonas said . ' ' laurence meyer is a big hawk on interest rates , and he basically talked a 180 . that was their big gun . the only bigger gun would have been greenspan . ' '

enron ' s collapse : market place
a big fall evoking nasty old memories of a run on a bank
by floyd norris
11 / 29 / 2001
the new york times
page 1 , column 1
c . 2001 new york times company
the final collapse of enron amounted to something that few living americans have ever seen : a bank run like those in the days before deposit insurance .
enron appeared to become a wildly successful company by creating a new , largely unregulated financial business , that of energy trading . that business ran on credit , and required suppliers and users of energy to sign contracts that called on enron to meet obligations months or years later .
enron became something like a bank , which takes depositors ' money and promises to pay it back later . but unlike banks in the current era , this institution had no federal deposit insurance to reassure customers when rumors began to spread that it was in trouble . that proved to be its achilles ' heel . enron ' s collapse is a reminder for big players in unregulated markets that their financial health must be beyond doubt .
before the advent of deposit insurance , bankers knew what was needed to head off a bank run . it was cash , so much cash that it would be clear that panic was unwarranted . nearly a century ago , j . p . morgan took the lead as he and fellow banking tycoons put up the millions needed to keep the trust company of america open . thus was halted the panic of 1907 .
as it happened , corporate descendants of two major institutions involved in that rescue - - j . p . morgan chase and citigroup - - were major players in the enron debacle . but they did not try the strategy this time .
instead , enron kept arranging an additional billion or two in loans , clearly struggling to find the money . morgan and citigroup allowed the word to spread that they were ready to put in more money on their own , but the amounts were relatively small , and somehow the money was never invested .
when dynegy agreed to buy enron , it put up $ 1 . 5 billion in cash only after it was assured that it would get control of the company ' s crown jewel , the northern natural gas pipeline system , or its money back , if the deal collapsed .
the final straw came on tuesday , when negotiations on a revised dynegy takeover deal came down to efforts to find $ 250 million or $ 500 million of enron assets that could serve as collateral for a new dynegy cash advance . the message to companies that traded with enron was clear : even its rescuer is demanding collateral , and is having trouble finding it .
given that , enron ' s financial business could not continue . public haggling over the terms of the rescue assured that no rescue was possible , something that would have been obvious to the original j . p . morgan but that seemed to escape his corporate heirs . as walter bagehot , the british financial journalist and historian , wrote in 1873 , ' ' every banker knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit , however good may be his arguments , in fact his credit is gone . ' '
the markets enron helped to create will endure , but probably without enron . it will be interesting to see whether participants in them continue to resist regulation as much as they have in the past . unregulated markets , especially when they are relatively new , can be very profitable for those with superior market knowledge , as enron seemed to have . but when prices are visible to all , the value of that knowledge plummets . regulation could bring more openness , but it could also bring structures , like clearing systems , that reassure traders they need not worry about the credit of those with whom they trade .
if the markets continue to be unregulated , enron ' s collapse makes it more likely that the big players in those markets will be companies that are already regulated enough to assure customers that they are secure - - companies like major banks and brokerage houses . that would be bad news for dynegy , which was enron ' s major competitor before it tried to become its acquirer .
the crisis at enron may have exposed a ' ' flaw in the business model ' ' of energy trading companies , said john diaz , a managing director at moody ' s , in an interview yesterday . ' ' companies in this industry need to think carefully about their liquidity management , ' ' he said . ' ' we ' re going to be looking very hard at this . ' '
the litigation over enron seems likely to be prolonged and expensive , but it may boil down to senator howard h . baker jr . ' s famous watergate - era question about president richard m . nixon : what did he know and when did he know it ?
that question will be asked about arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , and about its corporate officials , past and present . but it will be asked most particularly about the banks and investment banks that served enron and its affiliated off - balance - sheet entities in recent years .
enron ' s disclosures last week showed it needed to pay far more in debts over the next year than most people had understood to be the case . but the newly discovered loans did not materialize out of thin air . the money was lent by banks and bond buyers to the off - balance - sheet entities . those who were stuck with losses on the known enron debt may claim the financiers who syndicated the loans should have told them of all the other debt .
among those who do not come out of this looking very good are the bond rating agencies . just six weeks ago , after enron put out an earnings release showing strong pro - forma profits , as it defined them , two of the agencies , fitch and standard & poor ' s , reaffirmed enron ' s rating of triple - b plus . moody ' s , the agency that was the most skeptical about enron , put the rating under review and hinted it would , at worst , cut it one notch .
none of the rating agencies seemed overly concerned about a detail disclosed by enron at the time : a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to what it later said were accounting mistakes involving a partnership run by enron ' s chief financial officer . but that disclosure set off a cascade of questions that enron could not answer in a reassuring way . it ran through billions as companies demanded more protection to keep trading with it .
enron could have been saved , if an institution that was trusted - - whether that was chevron texaco , which put up the $ 1 . 5 billion cash that dynegy invested , or j . p . morgan chase or citigroup - - had made it clear that it was willing to stand behind enron . a credible backer would have ended the run .
but no one was willing to do that , and their hesitance as they learned more only accelerated the run . whether they were wise to avoid that exposure may become clear as it emerges how much creditors will eventually get .
finally , the rating agencies yesterday downgraded enron to relatively low levels of junk . they knew that was likely to force enron into bankruptcy in the near future , but they also knew that no one was willing to rescue a company that the agencies had viewed as solid only weeks before .
yesterday , as dynegy walked away from the merger , it said that it was no longer willing to trade with enron - - unless enron put up ' ' sufficient credit support . ' ' it knew that support was nowhere to be found .

enron ' s collapse : the chief executive
foundation gives way on chief ' s big dream

well before anyone could imagine that enron might collapse , kenneth l . lay was stumped . in an interview in august , he dismissed questions about a vague clause in the energy company ' s annual report that hinted at bigger problems if its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels .
' ' i just can ' t help you on that , ' ' he said . pressed further on questions about a bewildering constellation of business partnerships that involved enron ' s former chief financial officer , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' '
at the least , mr . lay - - a man of big ideas , a crusader for free markets , a risk taker in the texas wildcatter tradition - - had taken his eye off the ball . while he was busy befriending the nation ' s most powerful politicians , erecting one of the tallest buildings in houston and pasting enron ' s logo on the city ' s new ballpark , the little things were turning out to be mr . lay ' s big problems .
one after another , disclosures spilled out of his company over the last month : the partnerships had hidden billions in debt ; years of enron ' s reported profits had been exaggerated ; the government was investigating . rivals were shunning enron ' s energy trading desks , which mr . lay had built into the world ' s leaders . and sure enough , the stock price tumbled day after day , and credit agencies lowered enron ' s ratings once and then yesterday again , turning the company ' s debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock .
three weeks ago , mr . lay tried to salvage his creation by selling it to dynegy , his houston rival . yesterday , dynegy pulled out of the deal . deprived of enough information , and then repelled by what they learned , the free markets in which mr . lay had put so much faith all but destroyed , in a matter of weeks , everything he had built .
' ' if they had been going a slower speed , the results would not have been disastrous , ' ' said bob mcnair , a houston energy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company to enron three years ago . but enron , he said in an interview this month , was like a race car , and the markets like an unforgiving track . ' ' it ' s a lot harder to keep it on the track at 200 miles per hour , ' ' he said . ' ' you hit a bump and you ' re off the track . ' '
from his youth , mr . lay , 59 , had nurtured an abiding faith in the markets ' wisdom . he studied economics at the university of missouri , living at home to save on room and board , and eventually earned a ph . d . in the subject . as a naval officer serving in the pentagon , he worked to develop more efficient accounting systems . later , he served as an aide to a federal government regulator for the natural gas industry - - a market that enron would come to dominate .
moving into the private sector , he worked his way up the ranks of the natural gas industry , becoming chief executive in 1984 of the houston natural gas corporation , a big regional pipeline operator . he engineered its merger with internorth , an omaha pipeline company , and then became chief executive of the combined company and changed its name to enron .
mr . lay saw enron ' s mission as far more than being a conduit for fuel . at the time , gas prices were regulated and pipelines played a relatively passive role ; buyers and sellers could not cut deals on the fly . but as oil prices plunged in the mid - 80 ' s and gas users began switching to cheaper fuel oil , mr . lay returned to washington to argue , successfully , for rules changes that he said would save the pipeline business by allowing operators to shop for the best deals from both gas producers and utilities .
the new flexibility brought the threat of chaos , however , as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly . that is when the new enron was truly born . to help customers shield themselves from risk , mr . lay ' s enron developed hedging contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn and copper and winter wheat . its innovative ' ' gas bank ' ' let utilities lock up the long - term prices that they craved ; enron lined up the gas supplies from producers , arranged for delivery - - and took a cut of every deal .
that business became the forerunner of enron ' s entry into hundreds of other markets , helping customers obtain supplies and manage risks in products ranging from electric power to pulp and paper and , most recently , fast broadband access to the internet . trading soon provided more of the company ' s profits than the traditional natural gas business .
while other companies , including dynegy , focused on accumulating hard assets like pipelines , turbines and gas fields , enron increasingly saw itself as a pure trading company with an almost limitless future .
' ' there is a very reasonable chance that we will become the biggest corporation in the world , ' ' mr . lay ' s handpicked successor as enron ' s chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , told the authors of a book , just published , about business on the internet . even the book ' s title , ' ' radical e : from ge to enron - - lessons on how to rule the web ' ' ( ) , showed the cachet the company had attained . enron , the authors wrote , was ' ' creating a culture in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and rewarded . ' '
mr . skilling abruptly resigned in august , after just six months on the job , propelling mr . lay back into the gritty details of enron ' s businesses that he had sought to leave to others .
as the company grew , he had become increasingly involved in public affairs , serving as host when a global economic conference was held in houston in 1990 and when the republican national convention came to the city in 1992 .
like the leaders of many big texas businesses - - the construction colossus brown became good friends with the texas governor , ann richards ; and supported senator phil gramm of texas , whose wife , wendy , a former chairwoman of the commodities futures trading commission , joined enron ' s board .
' ' he ' s a stand - up guy , ' ' said ms . richards , now a business consultant in new york . asked to be more specific , she said , ' ' he ' s at the meeting ' ' - - meaning she could count on mr . lay to become directly involved with whatever she asked him to do , and not just sign onto a project for show .
mr . lay ' s deepest political ties were with the bush family . in the 1980 ' s , he became a major fund - raiser for george h . w . bush . when mr . bush lost his 1992 campaign for re - election as president , mr . lay brought a number of senior bush aides to enron as directors or consultants , including james a . baker iii , the former secretary of state , and robert a . mosbacher , the former secretary of commerce .
mr . lay also cultivated mr . bush ' s son george w . long before he was considered a serious national candidate . after the younger mr . bush ' s election as texas governor in 1994 , mr . lay became head of the governor ' s business council , an important advisory post .
the bond with president bush is personal . as governor , mr . bush sent mr . lay a kidding note in 1997 . ' ' one of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older - - just like you ! ' ' he wrote . ' ' 55 years old . wow ! that is really old . thank goodness you have such a young , beautiful wife , ' ' he added , a reference to mr . lay ' s wife , linda .
in 1999 , mr . lay sent a handwritten christmas note to mr . bush and his wife , laura . ' ' linda and i are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the white house , ' ' he wrote .
yesterday , the white house press secretary , ari fleischer , said the treasury department was monitoring enron ' s downfall for its effect on the market . asked if the president himself had any reaction , mr . fleisher said , ' ' the president ' s reaction is that it should be monitored . ' '
in some ways , enron ' s collapse was one more example of the bursting of the internet bubble . but mr . lay was not some stylish dot - com brat ; by all accounts , he is an immensely likable product of middle america . growing up in tiny rush hill , mo . , he was driving a tractor by age 12 and salting away savings . by 16 , his sister sharon recalled this week , ' ' he was bucking bales ' ' - - that is , loading hay - - ' ' and had two jobs in the summer , painting houses . ' '
' ' i don ' t think you could ever say that he did something the easy way , ' ' she said .
that work ethic ran in the family . mr . lay ' s father was a minister who also sold farm equipment . the family ' s finances were spotty , ' ' at times no money , at times some money , ' ' ms . lay recalled . still , the lays took in people from their church who were in need .
over the last decade or so , mr . lay earned some $ 300 million from enron , mostly by exercising stock options . earlier this month , when employees grew incensed at the prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the company ' s sale to dynegy , he volunteered to walk away from $ 60 million in payments .
mr . mcnair , the houston entrepreneur , who has known mr . lay for years , suggested that perhaps everything had not been disclosed to him . ' ' maybe the people who reported to him told him what they wanted him to hear , but they weren ' t telling him everything , ' ' he said .
mr . mcnair said he spoke to mr . lay recently and found him ' ' somewhat in a state of shock . ' ' mr . mcnair added , ' ' he ' s devastated . ' '
in the end , it seems , the man whose company did so much to help others manage their risk could not manage his own .

enron ' s collapse : the derivatives
market that deals in risks faces a novel one

c . 2001 new york times company
when members of the international swaps and derivatives association gathered in washington last april , the man they all wanted to hear was jeffrey k . skilling , then the president and chief executive of enron .
enron had helped create the global market for energy - based derivatives - - customized risk - swapping contracts that enable companies to hedge their exposure to changing energy prices and supply fluctuations . even among traders more familiar with interest - rate swaps or currency hedges than energy contracts , mr . skilling ' s presentation did not disappoint .
' ' he dazzled everybody - - it seemed he could figure out a way to trade the minutes on this phone call , ' ' one industry executive said .
but yesterday , many of those same executives were crossing their fingers and hoping that enron ' s crisis would not spread into the energy swaps market that the company had done so much to enliven .
as the day ended with fairly stable trading , there were a few cautious sighs of relief . but nobody is quite sure just how much money the energy - related derivatives markets will have at risk if enron fails .
according to swaps monitor publications , which collects data for the derivatives markets , enron ranks among the top energy - swaps traders in the world , on a par with financial giants like bank of america and barclay ' s .
at the end of september , enron ' s gross derivatives trading liabilities - - the amount of money it would owe to other market players if it filed for bankruptcy - - stood at $ 18 . 7 billion , up slightly from june levels but about $ 1 . 3 billion less than at the end of last year .
but that level may overstate the risk to other companies . ' ' these numbers do not take into account the unknown amount of collateral that enron may have posted , ' ' said paul spraos , swaps monitor ' s president . such collateral should , in principle , diminish enron ' s actual liabilities to the derivatives market , he said .
in a typical energy swap , a company will enter into a contract to lock in a fixed price of a certain commodity , like natural gas or electricity . the other company , the counterparty , in the deal assumes the risk of future price changes and quotes a fixed price that includes its own profit . the efficient trading and pricing of these contracts requires a marketplace with large , active traders .
as of last night , there were no signs of a major panic that would drive major participants to the sidelines , industry executives said .
' ' it ' s not likely that enron ' s problems will cause serious difficulty for any other sizable counterparty , ' ' said mark c . brickell , a veteran swaps - market executive and the chief executive of blackbird , a technology firm that operates an electronic swaps - trading system . ' ' while there may be some smaller firm that didn ' t manage its exposure as well as it might , that won ' t cause any major problems for the system as a whole . ' '
michael williams , managing director of tradespark , a rival to enron ' s online energy - trading system , agreed that there was ' ' no sign of shrinkage ' ' in the marketplace yesterday . ' ' so far , we ' ve seen no complaints about a lack of liquidity , ' ' he added .
most participants in the energy derivatives market rely on a standard contract that was developed by the international swaps and derivatives association and is recognized in the courts . the contract clearly specifies the rights each party has in the event of a default , said robert pickel , the association ' s chief executive . as of late yesterday , he added , the markets appeared ' ' to be fairly resilient in the face of extremely negative developments regarding such a major player . ' '
but at least one lawyer who specializes in swaps contracts indicated that it might be too soon to assess the full impact . that lawyer , ann o ' hara , in lincoln , neb . , said that her clients ' anxiety about enron had escalated sharply only in the last few days . ' ' no one believed it would really happen , ' ' she said . ' ' it is not a surprise , but it is a shock . ' '
' ' we don ' t really know who is out there exposed to enron ' s credit , ' ' she added . ' ' i ' m telling my clients to prepare for the worst . ' '

enron ' s collapse : the rating agencies
debt rankings finally fizzle , but the deal fizzled first
by alex berenson

the new york times

c . 2001 new york times company
in the end , the rating agencies hardly mattered .
for weeks , wall street wondered whether moody ' s investors service , standard & poor ' s and fitch ' s , the three major agencies rating corporate debt , would drop enron ' s rating below investment grade .
enron and dynegy warned that cutting the rating might jeopardize dynegy ' s acquisition of enron . executives at big securities firms that stood to profit from the deal pressed moody ' s to keep ratings at investment grade , even as enron bonds fell to levels indicating that the debt was highly risky .
but even an investment - grade rating could not save enron ' s business from collapse over the last month . after a series of damaging revelations about enron ' s finances , the company ' s partners demanded extra capital for its trades or stopped trading with it . by the time the rating agencies decided yesterday that enron might well default on its debt , dynegy had decided on its own to walk away .
' ' it wasn ' t really the reason that dynegy backed out of the deal , ' ' said todd shipman , the standard & poor ' s analyst who was the first to cut enron ' s rating yesterday .
the cuts dim the hopes enron had of avoiding bankruptcy . all three agencies slashed enron ' s debt far below investment grade . moody ' s cut enron ' s rating 5 notches , standard & poor ' s lowered it 6 , and fitch slashed it 10 , to cc , its third - lowest grade .
' ' default is a probability , ' ' said glen grabelsky , the senior director of credit policy for fitch . enron has $ 13 billion in debt outstanding and about $ 10 billion more in loans , made by partnerships , that the company has guaranteed .
the aggressive rating cuts may not mollify the investors who have sharply criticized the agencies for being slow to act in recent weeks . officials at all three agencies defended themselves yesterday , saying they had acted prudently .
after dynegy agreed to buy enron , moody ' s tried to calculate the chances that the deal would go through , that enron would remain strong until it was completed and that the combined company would carry a strong rating , said john diaz , managing director for moody ' s power and energy group .
at first , those questions seemed to have reassuring answers , mr . diaz said , so moody ' s kept enron ' s investment - grade rating .
but in recent days , other companies have shied away from doing business with enron , and its losses have soared . ' ' basic cash flow was slowing down at the same time that the cost structure of the company was the same , ' ' mr . diaz said . enron ' s mounting losses discouraged dynegy , he said .
' ' over the last 24 hours , the probability that we ' ve assigned to these three key issues was looking to be a lot smaller , ' ' mr . diaz said .
mr . grabelsky said the acquisition uncertainty presented the agencies with a situation where enron ' s debt could be very strong , if the deal worked , or highly risky .
' ' there is no middle ground , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s one or the other . ' '

although these are just single - digit positions , a loss from par value to 20 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent holding could trim off half of a fund ' s return , said scott berry , morningstar bond fund analyst .
the average intermediate bond fund has returned 7 . 3 per cent so far this year , according to morningstar . a loss from par value to 20 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent stake could reduce a 7 . 3 per cent return to roughly 3 . 3 per cent , mr berry said .
"" with bonds , there ' s much more downside than upside . typically , the downside is never realised because these investment - grade bonds are strong enough to weather the storm , but enron just caught everybody by surprise over the last couple of months , "" he said .
other large investment - grade bond funds that held enron ' s debt as of their most recent filings include the $ 13 . 6 bn fidelity short term bond fund , which held 0 . 77 per cent , worth $ 27 . 7 m as of april 30 , and two of the strong funds - the $ 1 . 36 m strong corporate bond fund , which held 0 . 77 per cent as of september 30 , or $ 10 . 5 m , and the $ 1 . 43 bn strong short term bond fund , with a 0 . 63 per cent holding , also as of september 30 , worth $ 9 m .
mr berry said managers of investment - grade bond funds that still held the debt were probably selling it , although most had the latitude to hold a bond once it lost its investment - grade status . however , they also said junk - bond fund managers were unlikely to buy it , because other "" fallen angel "" bonds such as xerox had not performed well .

companies & finance the americas - sec filing triggered merger crisis .

dynegy ' s rescue bid for enron went into "" crisis mode "" 10 days ago , said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive .
in a filing to the sec , enron revealed a previously undisclosed $ 690 m note payment due this week , as well as that it had $ 9 . 15 bn in debt due by the end of next year . the news provoked another round of selling in enron ' s already plunging share price , forcing dynegy into 18 - hour a day talks that ran through the thanksgiving weekend and up to midnight on tuesday . .
"" that may have been the last straw to some shareholders , "" mr watson said just hours after withdrawing from dynegy ' s $ 9 bn merger with enron . enron had been the biggest energy trader in the us until a crisis of confidence , beginning in october , that pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy .
"" every time we thought we had the pieces , "" he said . "" every time we put the puzzle together it wasn ' t a clear strategy to go forward . ""
he said the talks resumed yesterday at 7 am , but when the rating agencies began downgrading enron to junk status , mr watson called ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , to say "" it wasn ' t going to work "" .
"" once they downgraded the company , we thought , what was already an uphill battle , was too difficult , "" he said . mr watson said he offered to help any way he could and the two men - who have long been friendly , cross - town rivals - parted amicably .
mr watson has received several calls from other counter - parties in the business , thanking him for saving them from a meltdown by giving them the time to limit their exposure to enron . "" i don ' t feel like a saviour , i feel tired , "" he said . but he acknowledged he provided a vast number of enron ' s counterparties , partners and customers a chance to better protect themselves against enron ' s demise .
"" there was a really strong effort to make it happen , "" he said . "" in the end , we couldn ' t find a solution that didn ' t risk dynegy ' s responsibility to its shareholders and to its employees . ""
he says the merger agreement allows it to walk away with enron ' s most valuable asset , the northern natural gas pipeline , though if enron disputes that , at worst , it would leave with money invested in saving enron . "" we are as solid as we were going into ( the merger ) and , maybe , better for the experience , "" he said .

companies & finance the americas - financial system braces for a chain reaction .

gary silverman .
enron ' s woes are raising risks for the financial system , threatening to set off a chain reaction in the markets that could damage any number of participants in unforeseen ways .
individual banks could lose hundreds of millions of dollars apiece on loans to enron , but regulators are confident the lenders have sufficient capital to weather such a storm .
the bigger worry is that enron ' s difficulties could trigger ripple effects in much the same way as russia ' s default in 1998 destabilised the long - term capital management hedge fund .
prices for banking stocks tumbled yesterday in new york and london , in large part because no one really knows what would happen if enron were removed from the financial scene .
enron sat on a massive trading book , made up of complex derivatives transactions , some meant to stay in place for decades . on the other side were a host of counterparties , many of them energy companies that are not supervised by banking regulators .
the counterparties , in turn , have their own set of borrowing and trading relationships with banks that may be completely unaware of their customers ' ties to enron . bankers also fear that because so many of these counterparties were new to sophisticated trading , they may have been lax in collateralising their deals .
for leading banks , enron ' s woes could result in big hits to profits . just about every big lending bank has exposure to enron , according to members of the bank group .
at a meeting of enron ' s creditors last week , one banker estimated there could have been 500 bankers representing 20 or more banks .
jp morgan chase and citigroup are the most prominent members of the bank group , but barclays , credit lyonnais , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank and many others are exposed .
it was understood that jp morgan chase ' s direct exposure to enron approaches $ 900 m , about $ 500 m of it unsecured by the energy company ' s assets . citigroup ' s direct exposure could reach $ 800 m , about half unsecured .
european banks also could take hits . according to data from loanware , for example , westlb , the german state - owned bank , has a $ 580 m bridge facility outstanding . this was extended as trade financing last year and does not appear to have been syndicated .
however , analysts caution that determining the exposure of a particular bank to enron is virtually impossible for outsiders . many loans are syndicated or sold , and bankers are also making increasing use of credit derivatives that enable them to buy insurance against default from counterparties .
barclays , for example , is one of the most active arrangers of finance for enron but it has syndicated most of its initial exposure . its exposure is estimated at less than # 250 m ( $ 356 m ) . on the other hand , banks could be exposed to firms that dealt with enron , which sold credit default insurance to its trading partners , according to market participants .
investors rerated banking stocks yesterday to account for expected exposures . citigroup was down $ 2 . 75 , or 5 . 4 per cent , to $ 47 . 80 , while jp morgan was down $ 2 . 30 , or 5 . 78 per cent , to $ 37 . 50 . in london , shares in barclays fell 4 per cent , or 86 p , to 2093 p . additional reporting by joshua chaffin in new york and rebecca bream in london .

companies & finance the americas - traders avoid exposure to junk status fallout .

energy traders on both sides of the atlantic were doing very little business with enron even before credit rating agencies demoted the debt of the world ' s biggest power trader to junk status .
rivals have been anxiously calculating their potential exposure to an enron collapse for at least a month - since the true extent of the company ' s crisis emerged .
most traders before yesterday were only prepared to be buyers of electricity and gas from the group , on the basis that it was better to owe than be owed in these circumstances .
"" there would have been very few sellers to enron , "" said one trader last night .
the group accounts for about 25 per cent of energy trading in the us with a similar market share in the smaller european market .
the loss of such a large player could cause liquidity problems in the us , said one analyst .
europe - based energy groups , however , felt there was sufficient capacity in their market to fill the gap .
more worrying is the knock - on effect particularly on smaller companies should enron be unable to honour long - term contracts , said brian senior , director of trading and asset management at innogy , the uk arm of the demerged national power .
the collapse of enron ' s credit rating means that it may have to provide a lot of cash as collateral to cover long - term liabilities , with money being due as early as next monday , said mr senior .
most large energy groups stopped trading with enron in european markets two days ago .
"" the simplest thing is to pull the plug until they ' ve figured out what ' s going on , "" said one analyst .
martin stanley , president of european energy trading for txu , another large us energy group , said : "" we have halted trading with enron . we are sorry to see it happen because they are a very innovative company . ""
even before yesterday ' s events , txu , like other large traders , had been adding up how much it could be owed and how much it would owe , should enron fail to honour its obligations .
"" we have been looking at various scenarios and have implemented our credit event management process designed to minimise our cash exposure , "" said mr stanley .
"" we are comfortable with our cash position , "" he added .

negotiations over the fate of enron , the us energy trading group , had been described as having "" a lot of moving parts "" . yesterday , those parts finally broke loose as the credit rating agencies ' patience ended with a downgrade of the energy trader ' s debt to junk status , and dynegy , its erstwhile saviour , withdrew .
immediate concern centred on the possibility of a systemic risk to the energy markets . "" it ' s over , isn ' t it ? "" said gerald keenan , a partner at pwc . "" what it is going to engender is a daisy chain of defaults . ""
enrononline , the group ' s much - vaunted web - based commodities trading system , shut down , according to traders . counterparties in the energy market stopped trading with enron altogether . the shares , which at their peak last year traded at $ 90 , fell by nearly three - quarters to just over $ 1 . the bonds , which have been trading at levels consistent with imminent bankruptcy for two weeks , fell further .
enron ' s survival since its much smaller rival , dynegy , launched a rescue bid on november 9 , has depended on a fragile pact between dynegy , chevrontexaco ( which owns 26 per cent of dynegy and backed the bid ) , enron ' s lenders , its trading counterparties and the rating agencies . the logic of this pact was essentially circular .
when dynegy stepped in three weeks ago enron was in the early stages of its crisis of confidence . shareholders had been shocked by enron ' s admission that it would have to shrink shareholders ' funds by $ 1 . 2 bn to end a transaction with an off - balance - sheet vehicle established by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . suddenly , the lack of transparency they had been prepared to forgive while the shares rose was a liability .
searching for a way to arrest the downward spiral , ken lay , enron ' s chief executive , linked up with chuck watson , his counterpart at dynegy . dynegy ' s all - stock bid - valuing enron , on tuesday ' s closing prices , at $ 9 . 4 bn - was dependent , however , on the rating agencies not downgrading the energy ' s group ' s substantial debts to junk status .
such a downgrade , as enron explained in a regulatory filing last week , would require the group to repay , refinance or provide extra cash as collateral for some $ 3 . 9 bn of debts owed by off - balance - sheet trusts .
under pressure from enron and dynegy ' s bankers , the agencies refrained from downgrading the debt , and dynegy went ahead with its bid . the agencies justified their position by citing the pending bid .
it was an uncomfortable position for the agencies , however , and their resolve began to crumble last week as dynegy and enron talked about renegotiating the deal .
in a tersely worded note issued last wednesday , fitch , another rating agency , pointed out that if dynegy "" steps away entirely from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seems highly untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible "" .
yesterday , s & p , then moody ' s and fitch , finally broke the fragile ring of confidence that was holding lenders , bidders and enron itself together . in its note , s & p explained in stark terms how the virtuous circle of confidence might now become a vicious downward spiral .
the collapse of enron securities in capital markets made dynegy less likely to complete its takeover , s & p wrote . at the same time , enron ' s franchise in the energy markets had "" sustained significant damage "" , making it a less attractive target .
if enron does now disintegrate , the question is whether the chain reaction will extend beyond the houston company and drag in other energy traders , or even the banks that finance them . analysts had already begun to liken its situation to that of long - term capital management , whose demise in 1998 prompted the federal reserve to co - ordinate a rescue by wall street banks to avoid a financial crisis .
however , the head of one large commodities trader said the biggest market participants had had long enough to protect themselves from the collapse of enron .
but smaller groups could be affected and the fear is that the complexities of its balance sheet may still contain the seeds of a wider crisis . additional reporting by sheila mcnulty in houston .

new york - - enron corp . ' s lifeline merger deal collapsed wednesday , and the once - mighty energy trader slid toward all - but - certain bankruptcy .
its houston rival and neighbor dynegy inc . called off its planned takeover after wall street ' s major credit - rating agencies slashed enron ' s bonds to "" junk "" status wednesday morning .
investors and enron ' s trading partners had lost confidence well before the rating agencies did . in fact , it was the recent erosion of enron ' s trading business and the harrowing slide in its stock and bond prices that forced the ratings cut and triggered dynegy ' s decision to back out of the deal .
informed sources said dynegy ultimately balked after coming across much more debt than it expected in evaluating enron ' s finances and watching helplessly as the value of its would - be acquisition shrank dramatically when energy customers fled the firm .
with the merger called off , enron was "" exploring other options to protect our core energy businesses , "" kenneth l . lay , the company ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a brief statement that skirted the topic of bankruptcy .
the lack of a decent credit rating cripples enron ' s ability to run its trading business , the franchise that made it one of america ' s most admired companies but also gave it a reputation for arrogance and greed , particularly for its role in california ' s energy crisis .
computer screens went dark nationwide wednesday as the widely used enrononline internet - based trading system shut down .
enron ' s stock , already down 95 % for the year , tumbled $ 3 . 50 to close at 61 cents on wednesday in a trading stampede on the new york stock exchange . a one - day record of 339 million shares changed hands .
the whole company , once worth $ 63 billion , now is valued at less than $ 500 million , or about twice the cost of enron ' s new headquarters under construction in downtown houston .
dynegy shares , meanwhile , sank $ 4 . 92 to $ 35 . 97 , just below where they stood when dynegy agreed to acquire enron on nov . 9 .
dynegy exited the deal because it was "" unwilling to risk our franchise , our credit or our credibility , "" president stephen bergstrom said in a news conference wednesday .
"" we know when to say no , and this morning we said no , "" he said .
wall street had been saying no for days , hammering enron ' s stock to less than half the $ 10 . 41 a share that dynegy originally agreed to pay . dynegy was in the process of renegotiating its price downward when it finally threw in the towel .
the deal ' s lack of credibility with stock and bond investors prompted the top two rating agencies - - standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service - - to cut their ratings on enron , knowing that they probably were pronouncing a death sentence .
the ratings downgrade triggered clauses in enron loan agreements that require the company to immediately pay its creditors some $ 3 . 9 billion - - money that it doesn ' t have , analysts said .
the ripples from enron ' s collapse spread far and wide , even to the u . s . treasury market , where some investors fled for safety as enron ' s bonds plunged in value .
enron led a trend in energy trading , creating an internet - based network that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity , natural gas , oil and coal to do business with one another . the trades of contracts , often spanning many years at a fixed price range , are intended to protect major users and suppliers of energy from fluctuations in fuel prices .
energy market experts are split on the long - term effects of enron ' s collapse . some say the fallout will be slight , noting that rivals already have stepped in to take over business with trading partners who were too nervous to continue dealing with enron .
"" the whole industry should thank dynegy for basically buying them two or three weeks ' time to unwind their deals with enron , "" said analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york .
but enron was noted for the complexity of its long - term deals , and the effects of its withdrawal as a key player could be far - reaching and unexpected , other analysts said .
banking companies , dozens of which lent money to enron , saw their shares dip on worries about whether those loans will be repaid . shares of rival energy companies , too , lost value .
enron ' s chief lenders - - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - - each have about $ 800 million in loans that may be at risk in a bankruptcy , said richard strauss , a bank analyst with goldman , sachs ; photo : ( no caption ) ;

houston - - the likely bankruptcy of enron corp . could lead to a host of troubling consequences , including higher wholesale prices for electricity and natural gas and financial distress for banks and other firms as well as major bondholders and other investors , analysts said wednesday .
however , energy trading markets were calm as enron competitors picked up the slack while looking for opportunities to build or expand their own trading operations and acquire enron assets .
the concerns and maneuvering came as dynegy inc . on wednesday canceled its proposed acquisition of enron , once the world ' s largest energy trading company , after enron ' s debts were downgraded to non - investment "" junk "" status , making a bankruptcy filing highly likely .
"" banks are starting to worry about a financial meltdown from an enron collapse , "" said peter fusaro , president of global change , a risk management consultancy in new york .
enron ' s debts , which had been partly hidden in off - balance - sheet partnerships , could total $ 5 billion more than the company ' s assets , experts in new york and houston estimated .
citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , major commercial bankers to enron , will face losses if enron files for bankruptcy , analysts said . shares of citigroup and morgan declined more than 5 % on wednesday . other experts warned that investment banking firms such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley that had been part of enron ' s sophisticated trading network also could run into problems .
as enron , which rose rapidly in recent years to almost $ 200 billion in annual revenue , neared bankruptcy , shareholders faced being wiped out and investors in about $ 9 billion in enron bonds may get only cents on the dollar , analysts said .
enron ' s employees , 15 , 000 of whom hold enron stock in their 401 ( k ) retirement plans , stood to be among the biggest losers in the company ' s collapse . many probably also will lose their jobs .
major lawsuits against enron claiming lack of loyalty and prudence in dealing with its employees are among scores of lawsuits now confronting the company and arthur andersen , the accounting firm that approved enron ' s financial statements . enron is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for its handling of disclosure of the partnerships and subsidiaries .
and yet as enron ' s crisis approached a possible bankruptcy filing , a brisk optimism prevailed among energy traders . enron competitors were as enthusiastic about opportunities to buy parts of enron as they were fearful of the consequences of the big trader ' s collapse .
stephen baum , chief executive of sempra energy , the san diego - based utility holding company , said enrononline , the houston company ' s highly successful internet - based trading operation , would be acquired by other companies and carry on energy trading in the future .
sempra itself would be interested in discussing formation of such a new online trading firm , baum said , "" although its name would not be enron online . ""
baum added that sempra could be interested in acquiring several enron assets , in the u . s . and abroad .
energy markets were calm wednesday . kevin fox , manager of commodities and trading for aquila energy , a kansas city , mo . - based energy trader , described markets as "" surprisingly orderly . ""
enron ' s troubles have been building for well over a month , fox explained , and so the halt of enron online came as no surprise . fox saw no difficulty in his firm and other trading companies fulfilling enron ' s contracts should the energy company cease to operate .
still , others saw disrupted markets and price volatility . fears about the aftermath of enron ' s collapse centered on long - term commitments the firm has made in recent years to handle all the energy needs of giant entities such as the university of california system or to supply 10 years of natural gas at a fixed price range to an electricity generating station .
problems could arise because long - term contracts typically become encrusted with related transactions that hedge against price movements over time or the interest cost of financing . such complexity could make it difficult for other firms to pick up enron ' s long - term contracts .
if enron in bankruptcy "" can ' t cover its obligations , maybe other wholesalers can ' t either , "" said gordon allott , vice president at kw international , a trading and risk management firm in san francisco .
"" and then you have customers going out into the spot market , which could drive prices higher . that ' s the big bogey monster out there , "" allott said .
however , any effect on consumers from such disruptions could be slight . gerald keenan , head of the energy practice at , noted that enron ' s collapse would not "" affect the basic supply and demand for electricity and natural gas , "" the true determinant of prices .
one major factor reducing the effect of an enron collapse on markets and energy supplies is the growth in recent years of energy trading into a broad industry , with more than $ 300 billion in annual activity in contracts for electricity and the natural gas and oil fuels that produce it .
the intercontinental exchange , a consortium of six trading firms , handles more energy trades today than did enron .
if sempra and other companies acquire and operate enrononline , the industry will have two major groups to rely on . the need for energy trading has been growing out of deregulation and change in the electric utility industry .
"" trading absorbs risks of fuel - price movements and the like that used to be passed on to retail customers in the form of adjustments to monthly bills , "" fox explained .
the breadth and expertise of this new industry , as well as the months of enron ' s decline that gave competitors and markets time to adjust , could promise a relatively stable aftermath of enron ' s downfall .
however , the post - enron future is likely to see closer regulation of energy contract trading to increase disclosure of terms and risks .
but enron and its top executives , along with the arthur andersen accounting firm , face months and possibly years of lawsuits from shareholders who suffered losses as enron ' s stock lost more than $ 60 billion of market value in a single year .
and lawsuits by enron employees , challenging the firm ' s treatment of 401 ( k ) accounts , will go forward even if enron is in bankruptcy , said attorney lynn sarko of keller rohrback , a seattle law firm that is bringing one of the suits on behalf of employees .
"" there is still liability faced by fiduciaries , officials who were administrators of the savings plan and by the companies that insured it , "" sarko said .

stocks tumbled wednesday amid investors ' nagging uncertainty about the economy and as energy giant enron headed toward financial collapse . meanwhile , treasury bond yields were little changed . after sliding early in the session , they rebounded after the government got a tepid reception for a record sale of two - year notes .
on wall street , the dow industrials slid 160 . 74 points , or 1 . 6 % , to 9 , 711 . 86 . the market was in a steady decline most of the session .
the tech - dominated nasdaq composite suffered a 2 . 5 % decline , off 48 points to 1 , 887 . 97 .
losers topped winners by about 2 to 1 on the new york stock exchange and on nasdaq .
early in the week the market seemed poised to retake the 10 , 000 level on the dow and the 2 , 000 level on the nasdaq index . instead , sellers have gained the upper hand .
analysts noted that many investors aren ' t convinced the economy will improve in the first half of 2002 . for weeks , hopes that business will improve early next year have been boosting the market .
"" we ' re not out of the woods yet "" with the economy , said richard jandrainof banc one investment advisors corp .
the federal reserve ' s latest report on conditions by region , released wednesday , painted a generally somber picture of the economy .
still , many analysts said stocks ' sell - off this week doesn ' t appear to be anything special .
"" the reality is , we were due for some pullback , "" said barry hyman , chief investment strategist at ehrenkrantz king nussbaum .
hyman and other analysts were actually pleased to see investors take a cautious step back after fearing that the market was rising too much and too quickly .
the market ' s softness was spread across most sectors , but one of the weakest spots was utilities , which dropped after dynegy backed out of its planned merger with enron .
nyse - listed enron broke the record for heaviest trading in a single day with more than 339 million shares changing hands , as it fell $ 3 . 50 to 61 cents . the previous volume record was the 304 million shares of intel traded on nasdaq on sept . 22 , 2000 .
investors were selling most utility stocks wednesday . the dow utilities average fell 2 . 9 % to a 52 - week low of 279 . 95 .
financial stocks were slammed on worries about spillover from an enron collapse . j . p . morgan chase sank $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , and citigroup dropped $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 . both are in the dow .
retailing issues remained vulnerable to concerns that this holiday shopping season will be the worst in a decade . gap stumbled 79 cents to $ 13 . 61 after prudential securities reduced its rating on the clothier to "" sell "" from "" hold "" and called its holiday merchandise poor . electronics retailer best buy fell $ 1 . 18 to $ 69 . 90 , and bed , bath & beyond declined 74 cents to $ 32 . 34 .
technology also was weaker as investors fear there is still too much inventory and not enough demand . chip equipment maker altera fell $ 1 . 83 to $ 21 . 83 ahead of its update on business in the fourth quarter . after the market closed , altera reaffirmed its revenue projections for the year ' s final three months .
ibm , another dow stock , dropped $ 2 . 05 to $ 112 . 15 after announcing it will cut 1 , 000 jobs from its seven u . s . chip plants because of a slowdown in the microprocessor industry .
what was bad for stocks normally would be good for bonds , but that wasn ' t the case by the close of trading wednesday .
yields fell early in the day , then reversed after the government ' s biggest sale ever of two - year notes flooded the market with debt .
the treasury sold $ 21 billion of the two - year notes at a yield of 3 % , up from $ 19 billion sold in october , part of an effort by the government to finance a spending increase using short - dated debt .
the five - year t - note yield ended unchanged at 4 . 29 % . the 10 - year t - note ended at 4 . 93 % , up from 4 . 92 % .

after dynegy pulled out of its deal to buy enron corp . wednesday morning , it appeared the most likely option for enron was bankruptcy protection .
from wall street to houston , it was widely expected enron would file for bankruptcy , perhaps as soon as today .
"" it ' s probably imminent , "" said andre meade , a stock analyst with commerzbank securities in new york .
jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , said wednesday night that enron was evaluating all its options for restructuring its balance sheet and debt , and ways to return its business to health .
mcmahon said enron wasn ' t considering a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing , which would involve a liquidation or selling of all assets .
he didn ' t rule out a chapter 11 filing , which lets a company protect assets while it works out a reorganization plan , but he stressed that enron was also reviewing other options .
he declined to describe what the options are , but said he prefers to fix enron without a bankruptcy .
earlier wednesday , enron said it had suspended making payments other than those needed to maintain core business operations and it was working to retain employees needed for its trading and other core energy businesses . no layoffs were announced .
wall street doesn ' t believe enron has real choices other than bankruptcy . shares in enron lost much of their value wednesday , closing at 61 cents . the company , which was dropped from the standard & poor ' s 500 index , also broke the record for most shares traded in a day .
before oct . 16 , a buyout by dynegy , let alone a bankruptcy , were unthinkable for houston ' s largest company and the world ' s largest energy trader . but that day , enron disclosed millions in financial losses related to investment partnerships it did business with and were run by enron ' s since - ousted chief financial officer .
in the days and weeks that followed , the securities and exchange commission started investigating enron , a stack of shareholder and employee lawsuits were filed , enron restated earnings and made disclosures about its balance sheet that wall street found troubling .
dynegy swooped in to rescue enron when the two companies agreed to a merger deal nov . 9 . but continuing bad news surrounding enron put pressure on that deal .
until wednesday morning , it appeared enron and dynegy would find a way to rescue the merger by revamping its terms .
after several days of talks among the companies , bankers and others , chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in an interview he concluded a solution wasn ' t reachable .
the final confirmation for watson was when standard & poor ' s wednesday morning cut enron ' s credit rating to so - called junk status , effectively halting enron ' s ability to run its core business of energy trading and marketing , which is dependent on access to cash and credit . that trading franchise was a key reason for dynegy ' s interest in enron .
s & p said in its rating report that it cut enron ' s credit rating because it didn ' t believe the merger , which wasn ' t expected to close for six to nine months , would go through .
when the companies inked the deal on nov . 9 , watson said he expected no more surprises about enron ' s financial state . but the deal included escape clauses just in case .
among reasons dynegy cited for ending the merger were "" breaches of representations "" by enron . it also invoked an escape provision that let dynegy to walk away if enron had a "" material adverse change "" in its business .
"" we have never been willing to risk our franchise , our credit or our credibility , "" watson said . "" we knew when to say no and this morning we said no . ""
since nov . 9 , enron made new financial disclosures and saw significant drops in its stock price and trading business . all of that caused dynegy to seek new terms for the merger agreement , including a lower price , cash infusions to stabilize enron and a restructuring of enron ' s debt repayment schedule .
watson traced the beginning of the end to nov . 19 , the day enron filed its 10 q with securities regulators . companies must file their 10 q every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet with the sec .
dynegy was hit by surprise when enron disclosed it would have to pay off a specific debt obligation worth $ 690 million almost immediately and when it saw that enron ' s cash situation wasn ' t what it expected , watson said .
those disclosures , he said , caused enron ' s trading business , which had somewhat of an uptick after the merger announcement , to go "" down again and down again . ""
"" that was sort of a blow that we never really recovered from , "" watson said .
watson said he worked hard to rescue the deal , but would only go for a "" global solution "" that would take care of all the problems . for one , he said , enron needed another $ 1 billion - $ 3 billion infusion to keep going .

another jolt

shortly after enron corp . ' s bond ratings were cut to junk status wednesday , energy trader charlie sanchez watched the company ' s trading business simply vanish from his computer screen .
"" i watched their different markets just peel off my screen , one by one , "" said sanchez , energy markets manager at gelber & associates in houston .
although enron ' s troubles were well - known , the collapse of enron ' s trading business wednesday still jolted traders . sanchez just said , "" i ' m in shock . ""
the downgrade of enron ' s debt was the first domino to fall wednesday , followed by the shutdown of enron ' s online trading business and then the announcement that dynegy had called off its deal to buy enron .
enrononline , the company ' s internet commodity trading platform , went down early wednesday , signaling that the company had temporarily halted trading altogether . enrononline handles about 60 percent of the company ' s trading business , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in deals .
enron ' s chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said he didn ' t know when enrononline would be up for trading again . however , the company continues to do telephone transactions , he said .
the commodities markets appeared to weather the event . but the shutdown of the company that was by far the biggest player in the market led other companies that regularly dealt with enron to hastily issue statements assuring investors they were not going to be dragged down as well .
with enrononline down , many traders had to revert to calling around to numerous sources to find out what the market was doing rather than simply logging onto enrononline and clicking on a single tab to size up the market where they wanted to trade .
but as far as the overall impact on commodities markets and the new york mercantile exchange , the loss of enron ' s trading business for whatever period likely will not be that big , said kyle cooper , oil analyst with salomon smith barney in houston .
"" it could widen the bid - ask spreads in a few places , but in terms of liquidity on the nymex , you ' re talking about a few thousand contracts out of 60 , 000 to 70 , 000 contracts in all , "" cooper said .
one trader described enron as "" a needle in a haystack in terms of the total long - term capital markets . ""
nonetheless , the shutdown prompted a call for closer monitoring during a briefing at the white house .
u . s . treasury department officials kept a close eye on the credit and energy markets wednesday but discerned no upheavals from the troubles at enron .
"" we are monitoring credit markets as we do every day "" treasury spokeswoman michele davis said . "" we haven ' t seen anything extraordinary . ""
the exit of enron will lead to a change in the balance of power in the trading business . traders said companies that likely will benefit from the loss of enron ' s trading activities include el paso corp . , mirant corp . , reliant energy and duke energy .
the market appeared more worried about possible losses connected with enron .
el paso corp . ' s stock took a beating wednesday - - down $ 3 . 59 to close at $ 44 . 91 - - over concerns that it had too much exposure to enron through its trading business . the company issued a statement saying it had "" systematically reduced its trading with enron "" over the past few weeks .
"" due to enron ' s loss of investment grade status , any new business will have to be supported by cash collateral . el paso foresees no material disruptions in the energy trading markets resulting from today ' s downgrades or the potential of an enron bankruptcy filing , "" according to the company ' s statement .
el paso ' s natural gas and power trading exposure to enron is about $ 50 million , the company said , adding that it does not expect any adverse earnings impact from enron ' s difficulties .
atlanta - based mirant said its exposure to enron is $ 50 million to $ 60 million , noting that it too had begun limiting its exposure risk early in what it described as "" the enron crisis . ""
calpine corp . said it had no "" net exposure "" to enron , which means that what enron owes calpine for gas and electric trading is offset by calpine ' s liabilities to enron .
enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . as a result , they were either demanding more collateral to ensure it delivered on trades or restricting dealings with the houston - based company .
"" each company is going to have to evaluate what their situation is from producers to utilities , it ' s going to be a case - by - case situation . it ' s going to take a long time to figure it all out , "" said one trader who asked not to be quoted by name .
shortly after the news of the company ' s latest problems broke , a flood of huge trading orders came out of enron , leading traders to speculate that the company was scrambling to clear its accounts before filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
a typical order from the company would be for 100 contracts in a single lot to buy or sell commodities such as natural gas . after the debt downgrade was announced , single orders for 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 contracts began coming from the company .
the flood of large orders out of enron caused the near - month futures contract on the new york mercantile exchange to spike up and then fall off just as quickly in late morning trading .
"" they could not leave this exposure to the whims of the market , "" one trader said . "" they needed to get out . ""
enron reportedly has been working over the past few weeks to line up alternate parties to hand off their thousands of contracts the company handles daily , many of which are for long term periods such as 10 to 15 years .
but some of the more obscure contracts on items such as emissions credits and weather derivatives may be more difficult to unload . in addition to natural gas , power and oil , enron trades such items as broadband , paper , metals and water .
"" i really think that a lot of the kinds of stuff that is foreign and esoteric that enron has been making a market in will take a while for others to pick up , "" sanchez said .

bankruptcy filing by enron could be largest ever
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
if enron files for chapter 11 bankruptcy this week , as many observers expect it will , it may be the largest such event to date .
with $ 61 . 7 billion in assets on its books as of sept . 30 , the deal would top texaco ' s 1987 bankruptcy , which sought protection for a company with $ 35 . 9 billion in assets . it would also beat the 1988 bankruptcy of financial corporation of america , which had $ 33 . 9 billion in assets .
the value of the assets and liabilities on enron ' s books continues to be a moving target , however . while enron ' s unaudited quarterly financial report indicates $ 61 . 7 billion in assets , $ 27 billion in liabilities , $ 6 . 5 billion in long - term debt and $ 15 . 3 billion in deferred credits , the turmoil of the past month has changed much of that .
on the asset side , for example , the company says properties like its natural gas transmission lines , fiber optic network and electric generation facilities are worth close to $ 14 . 6 billion . much of the gas pipeline properties have been encumbered in recent weeks , however , by the company ' s efforts to raise additional cash and credit from banks .
and the likelihood the company could find buyers to pay its asking price for assets like the fiber optic network or overseas power plants is highly unlikely , said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst with rating agency fitch .
"" it ' s really a buyer ' s market , not a seller ' s market , "" pellechia said . "" it ' s anticipated a lot of their assets , particularly their international assets , would go for a lot less than the initial investment in them . ""
the company also counts $ 7 . 1 billion in investments and advances to "" unconsolidated affiliates "" as assets , which could include enron equity that was used to back some of the complicated off - balance - sheet financing partnerships that led to the company ' s current woes . given the constant surprises surrounding those partnerships and the company ' s steeply dropping stock price - - now worth less than a cup of coffee - - that $ 7 . 1 billion figure is also suspect .
several unexpected debt obligations related to the partnerships enron operated have also changed the tally since sept . 30 . analysts say debts for the company range between $ 13 billion and $ 17 billion , including another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments related to two special partnerships , osprey trust and marlin water trust , that will come due more quickly than expected following the credit rating agency downgrades on wednesday .
"" all these changes are making the situation like sand falling between their fingers , "" said bill porter , chairman of houston law firm porter & hedges . "" the only alternative left to them to stabilize their situation is bankruptcy protection . ""
company officials say they ' re still reviewing options , but on wednesday said they are temporarily suspending all payments to creditors other than those needed to maintain core energy trading operations .
"" with dynegy ' s termination of the merger and the ratings agency downgrades , we are evaluating and exploring other options to protect our core energy businesses , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement .
sources familiar with the broken enron - dynegy deal said the paperwork for a bankruptcy filing has been in the works for weeks , and even preceded the nov . 9 merger announcement . they say if the preliminary deal had not been secured that day , enron would have had to file for bankruptcy the following monday .
recent efforts by enron ' s bankers , including j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , to get creditors to hold off on demanding payments may mean the pending bankruptcy filing will be what is known as a prepackaged deal .
in a prepackaged bankruptcy , creditors agree beforehand how the sale of the company ' s assets would be divided among them . it would save all parties untold millions in legal fees that would be spent fighting over the company while assuring at least some recovery of their investments .
prepackaged bankruptcies are common , said jay westbrook , a professor at the university of texas school of law , because they allow companies to buy parts of the faltering business they want without the hassles of long , drawn - out legal battles .
"" the purchasers will essentially just pay their money and walk away , with the proceeds getting divided up among those holding claims , "" westbrook said .
chapter 11 bankruptcy has the added benefit of freezing the many lawsuits that have been filed by angry shareholders . those lawsuits would eventually be handled by the bankruptcy court , including determination of the validity of the claims in the suits .
if enron ' s bankruptcy is not prepackaged , it ' s almost assured that the value of enron ' s remaining businesses , such as its energy trading , will disappear , said bob chapman , a principle with houston management consulting firm king , chapman & broussard .
"" the only guys that do well in bankruptcies are the lawyers , "" chapman said . "" what you usually see is a long period of people trying to carve up the beast where what remains of the business will continue to atrophy . ""
because the company will most likely look to simply liquidate its assets , what would at first be a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing could later be converted to a chapter 7 filing , where a court - appointed trustee overseas liquidation of the remaining assets .
"" from our perspective , a lot of the future rests in the hands of the banks , "" said fitch analyst glen grabelsky . "" what their intentions are in granting forbearance , what kind of liquidity they ' re willing to extend to enron , only they can answer . ""

ballpark place project stopped dead in tracks
by ralph bivins
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
construction of the ballpark place tower has been postponed , partly because of the uncertainty surrounding enron corp . , the project ' s developer announced wednesday .
trammell crow co . had anticipated breaking ground this week on the 34 - story tower across from enron field , said matt khourie , who heads trammell crow operations in houston .
ballpark place was planned for a parcel of land owned by the developer , bounded by preston , prairie , crawford and la branch streets .
the $ 108 million ballpark place was expected to be a dominant skyline feature , rising over left field at enron ' s namesake stadium .
ballpark place would have included 253 , 000 square feet of office space , 216 apartment units , ground - level retail space and several levels of covered parking .
questions surrounding the future of enron corp . , a major employer in downtown , was key in encouraging trammell crow to shelve its plans , khourie said .
enron has about 3 million square feet of downtown office space , including a 40 - story building under construction . as enron ' s need for space decreases , the downtown office market is sure to feel the aftershocks .
"" given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty associated with the future availability of class - a space springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to delay our construction start until the future visibility improves , "" khourie said in a written statement .
it has been widely speculated that dynegy , another houston energy firm , would move into the new enron building .
but dynegy ' s plans to buy enron fell apart wednesday , leaving questions about the the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot tower .
trammell crow has not abandoned its plans for ballpark place .
khourie said the company intends to start construction , perhaps next year , after the economy improves .
"" we are still very bullish on the project ' s residential / office mixed - use concept for our unique location and also are optimistic on the mid - and long - term prospects for houston ' s central business district , "" khourie said .
"" the decision to delay relates directly to the short - term environment that we are currently facing . """,0

subject : updated - approval authorizations
as mentioned in my previous memo regarding cash control standards , approval
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment . corporate
accounts payable is actively pursuing a "" workflow "" system to route invoice
images for approval and processing . this workflow solution will not be
implemented until early 2001 . in the interim , an approval process will be
implemented by ap and treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and
correct general ledger coding . effective monday , november 20 the following
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices , payment requests
and wire transfer requests that are $ 1 , 000 , 000 or greater :
( a ) those not approved by an underlying contract or rac require two
approvals : a managing director approval of the payment , and an accounting
director approval of the general ledger coding .
( b ) those that are approved by an underlying contract or rac require an
accounting director approval of the payment and general ledger coding .
in both examples above , supporting documentation must be attached . if not
attached , then the payment will not be processed .
to assist us with implementing this approval process , i ' m requesting each of
you to accumulate signatures of the managing directors and accounting
directors in your business unit using the attached form . please forward this
information to larry dallman ( jfr 568 ) by friday , november 10 th .
this new process becomes effective monday , november 20 th . it important to
provide this information or payments greater than $ 1 , 000 , 000 will not be
processed .",0

i have an issue with this format . when you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up . we have run into this issue before , and that is why we have not put it in frames . we may need to look at another format to cover the on - line users and the customers that print this report . this has been an on going issue on - line when you scroll down you lose the header . the printing customers won ' t think to highly of this format . my suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides ( printing and viewing ) . jeff / perry , we may have to get together and discuss this issue .

subject : re : commercialization of back office competitor
brad ,
you are right , aquila ' s riskl 80 is similar to kiodex ' s offering . it is a web - based reporting and valuation tool ( no software downloads are needed ) . the difference is that riskl 80 focuses on reporting and valuation . in other words , riskl 80 does not offer pricing calculators as does kiodex ' s . it seems to me that kiodex ' s risk workbench is a more robust solution because it provides decision tools to price opportunities before transacting while riskl 80 is "" after the fact "" reporting and transacting . it looks to me that when commodity logic launches its risk valuation modules it will become more of a direct competitor to riskl 80 .
in its initial phase , riskl 80 is offering services to the gas market only . soon , they will offer the tools for the power markets .
riskl 80 ' s products :
otc trade preview - details of transactions as entered into system
daily / monthly futures and forwards reports - position exposures and daily pal ' s based on mark - to - market accounting
options valuation report - measures exposures due to options plus volatility calculations ( i . e . greeks )
daily / monthly total position summary - total picture of risk exposure in the portfolio
riskl 80 ' s target market :
similar to commodity logic ' s market . they will target medium to small shops that do not have the technology , staff , or resources to run sophisticated reporting and valuation in - house .
let me know if you have any questions .

aquila launches cost - effective energy risk management service
kansas city , mo . - - ( business wire ) - - aug . 27 , 2001 - - aquila , inc . ( nyse : ila - news ) , one of the largest north american wholesalers of natural gas and electricity and risk management organizations , today launched riskl 80 ( sm ) , a product that provides clients with full - service management of their commodity transactions , delivered to them daily , weekly or monthly via the web .
riskl 80 will be marketed to utilities , municipalities , energy aggregators and small energy marketers , as well as large industrial firms . these clients typically are low - volume traders that use spreadsheets to manage their energy transactions . the product was designed to meet the deal capture and portfolio valuation needs of clients who do not wish to purchase or build an expensive , enterprise - wide risk management software system .
using a password - protected web - interface , clients send aquila their transactions or trades , which are then processed through the company ' s proprietary system . the client then receives daily , weekly or monthly risk analysis and deal pricing reports .
` ` what we are doing is making it possible for these clients to have access to a highly sophisticated trading organization , its skills and most important , its collective knowledge , ' ' said jennifer fisher , aquila vice president and head of the radius group .
aquila ' s radius group jointly developed riskl 80 with sungard trading and risk systems , a leading energy risk management software firm . a key component of the riskl 80 package is its use of sungard ' s epsilon software for risk analysis and client reporting .
riskl 80 will initially handle only natural gas transactions . power transaction capabilities will be added in the near future . data available to clients includes detailed portfolio valuation , evening over - the - counter trade previews , mark - to - market income reports , total position reports as well as forward curves , deal capture and value - at - risk calculations . additional information is available at www . aquila . com , or www . riskl 80 . com
based in kansas city , aquila is one of the top wholesalers of electricity and natural gas in north america and is an innovative provider of risk management products and services . the company also owns and controls a diverse portfolio of merchant assets , including power plants , gas storage , pipeline , and processing facilities , and other complementary merchant infrastructure facilities . outside north america , aquila provides wholesale energy services in the united kingdom , scandinavia and germany . aquila is 80 percent owned by utilicorp united ( nyse : ucu - news ) , a multinational energy company based in kansas city with more than 4 million customers . it operates in the united states , canada , new zealand and australia .

i just wanted to give you an update on where we are on the pcg wish list .
we discussed about a month ago the fact that we had close to 200 items on our
list of development / enhancements to our applications . we met on numerous
occasions with mark d . and team to prioritize , etc . however , i think
primarily due to the reorg in it , and mark leaving the team , we have done a
lot of talking over the past three weeks , but nothing has happened to date .
jennifer and i met with hal elrod yesterday , and i have met with bob hillier
a couple of times , and we seem to be on the right track now . i know bob
hiller is looking for people in his group to support these needs .
my concern is growing due to the fact that andrew parsons and team will be
re - auditing us before the end of the year . the key control weakness of the
pcg was the lack of profiles manger - i have stressed that this is # 1 on the
list of things to do . i think we are fairly close , but we will need to start
and complete testing over the next several weeks . my hope is that we push
andrew back as far as possible !

subject : softs ( ag ) support
hi guys ,
i thought i would quickly update you on a few meetings we ' ve had with the ag
folks here over the past 2 days . they are extremely interested in weather
support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date . a
summary :
1 ) they are interested in cocoa , coffee and sugar . specifically :
brazil : londrina , bauru , lavras ( all wmos available in accuweather )
vietnam : kentum , dalat ( no data immediately evident )
ivory coast : man , gagnoa ( wmos in accuwx )
indonesia : sumatra - kotubumi , sulawesi - dolo ( no data immediately evident )
2 ) they are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature ,
precipitation or wind . they are also interested in any trend information we
can devise . links between enso or other large scale oscillations that could
have long range effects . tony has already given their group a 101 course on
enso and its impacts on these areas .
3 ) they would eventually like daily am briefings - along with a daily product
related to their market ( ie precip / temp graphs etc )
4 ) they do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have
some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best .
tony and i agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to
see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible . we
should be able to add any lat / long points we want to the list of
international cities streaming through from the mrf / avn / ecmwf from earthsat .
the problems here would be the models ' problems handling tropical weather
along with specific local effects - especially in indonesia .
let ' s talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together .

"Subject: re : thanks !
karin ,
i talked to mike roberts ( the head of the whole weather team ) , and he is
saying that all expenses for tony should be charged to global products team .
this is agreed between vince and jeff shankman .
mike and vince are negotiating with john to put stephen ( or somebody who will
replace him ) to some other cost centres ( via research ) .
it looks like kevin moore is happy if stephen is charged to the same cost
centre as tony .
let us right now charge tony and stephen to the cost centre below .
please , could we charge them separately - when john and vince make their
decision , we should be able to re - charge .

hi karin . . .
i hope you had a splendid holiday ! i wanted to thank you for getting tony
and i set up here last week . we seem to have established a steady daily
routine and are supporting several different trading groups in london as well
as continuing our daily support of traders in houston . we ' ve gotten far more
requests for information than we expected , so as a result i will be remaining
in london a little longer than originally expected . as of now - i ' m not sure
exactly when i ' ll be going back to houston - but vince has let me know that i
will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather
support for the london traders .
to that end - i think i will need one additional piece of software installed
on the machine that i will be using on a regular basis . could i please get
microsoft frontpage installed as soon as we can get it ?
that leads to the second issue of desks . i know that space is a premium here
- and i understand that i may need to move around some as a result . i
certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but i also
wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that
are essential for the daily trader support in london and houston . as such ,
if i move , we will need to make sure that these applications are available
from the beginning of the day ( we start about 0600 ) . the applications are :
1 ) adobe acrobat - full version
2 ) accuweather for windows - ( this is something i will need to install )
3 ) microsoft front page
4 ) terminal server
5 ) the full ms office software package
one idea would be to have a pc move with me - that way we would not need to
reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support
routine .
thanks again for all of your help . i will let you know - once i know - how
long i will be here . i should hear something from vince over the next few
days giving me an idea .
cheers ,
steve

we interfaced unify to sap three times today . interface number one ( 8 : 40 am )
was error free . the second interface ( noon ) created duplicate invoices for
those sent in our first interface . the problem that caused the duplication
was that the flag in unify that prevents invoices from being sent to sap
after they have already been interfaced did not work . the problem was
corrected before out third interface at 3 : 15 pm . in the 3 : 15 interface , one
error occurred - - - a counterparty was set up in global as intercompany that
should be third party . this error will be corrected before our next interface
on 7 / 6 am .
overall , i was pleased at how well the interfaces worked today and how fast
the sap and unify teams responded to our issues .

dr . kaminski ,
i think i ' ll be able to start work from the last week of may ,
but not from monday ,
probably , i ' ll be able to work from 5 / 30 ( wed ) .
will it be good ? i know it is not that much earlier than i mentioned . . 6 / 4
i am sorry .
and actually , there is an e - business conference at haas school of business ,
organized by my advisor
could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e - business and especially procurement ?
the link is as following .
i am afraid you might forgot this i told you in the last email . . .
my advisor ( arie segev at haas school of business ; segev @ haas . berkeley . edu )
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer , while i am staying there .
his interest is in e - business . . ( what else . . ? )
and has expertise in e - procurement system and marketplace . . .
xml based standard such as obi , cxml , xcbl , rosettanet , biztalk . .
system interoperability study , auction and negotiation , workflow system ,
e - catalog management , digital signature , edi , etc etc . . .
many technical aspects of e - business . . .
he wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both enron and him .
he may travel one or two times to houston to have a meeting during the
summer .
( and to be frankly , this will be good for me too ,
because i can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in houston . . )
could you think about the possibility of joint research , with him ?
thank you . .
sincerely ,

business highlights
east power midwest origination
beginning late 2000 , east power marketing implemented a complete market
coverage strategy . since then , epmi has begun to develop relationships with
hundreds of small  & mom & pop  8 municipalities . many of these munis had no
prior contact with enron . as a result , east power has executed a valuable 30
mw energy call option term purchase from the municipal energy agency of
nebraska ( mean ) at a congested location .
enron industrial markets
eim has renamed pulp , paper the state power
exchange effectively replaced three monopoly buyers with one monopoly buyer .
deregulation does not mean buying all of your commodity at the last minute ,
on the spot market , rather than planning ahead and purchasing most of the
power under long - term contracts that lock in prices .
the situation in california is the result of continued regulation ,
complicated by a series of natural and man - made factors .

i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
in your example # 1 .
if we do the fee this way , we will not double up the volumes .

2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i

hi stinson , shales ' initial in road to ebs was through david cox ( after
vince ' s suggest to talk to david , i think ) . what shalesh did at the time was
to put a four page concept on trading storage as a commodity in the new
networked world . he has keen interest in such an idea and has done some
work . he will be a good fit unless that person has to be in ebs under jean
etc . . . . if so , we are not ready to let shalesh go ! he can support that
effort , but i need him to get the supply & demand work in real - time user
friendly form for jean ' s traders before shalesh ventures onto something
else . i did promising that i will get him involved in some juicy stuff like

i can pick up the cost of your trip from the research group budget .

vince
thanks for offering to look my presentation over . the deadline for
submission has been extended until tomorrow ( friday ) , so there ' s less of a
hurry .
as regard our summer visits , we ' ll need to speak to dale over the budget .
personal commitments mean it ' s difficult for me to take two whole months to
visit , so if the cost is prohibitive i may need to make just one shorter
visit . i ' d obviously like to spend longer , and two visits seems to be the
only way i can do it . i believe the situation is similar for kirstee .
i ' ve persuaded richard to pay for matt ' s visit in its entirety , and i ' ve no
doubt that rac / credit trading will pick up the bills for ben and kirstee .
it ' s difficult to think who ' d be the natural group to pay for me . i honestly
think i ' ll have difficulty persuading , e . g . richard , that it ' s worth his
while to pay for my visit . i get the impression he thinks i ' m doing ok
without the need to go to houston for further training .
i ' m interviewing a candidate for bjorn ' s model review role during today ' s
videoconference , so we ' ll need to speak beforehand or perhaps friday .

hello mike ,
i work in rodney malcolm ' s commercial transaction group , focusing on
developing energy management relationships with large volume industrial
energy consumers . due to the volatility and high price levels of the natural
gas contract , these consumers of natural gas are extremely concerned about
this exposure , and they are asking for our assistance in helping them manage
this exposure . one of the tools that these customers are requesting is
technical analysis of the natural gas contract so as to determine entry
points for their hedges .
to the extent you could assist us with this analysis , we can proactively
meet these customer requests and increase our deal flow .
please advise as to the availability of your assistance .

hello all ,
the program for the 2000 texas finance festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at
i do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on san antonio .
first , be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations .
at last count there were only 6 rooms left . second , i need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count .
i am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form .
remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on friday
so plan on arriving early friday or coming in on thursday evening if you
can . our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area ( the alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel ) .
we are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
friday and saturday evenings . the friday evening dinner begins at 6 p . m .
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
alamo at 8 : 00 p . m . for saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned .
there will be more information later as the conference nears . looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful , sunny san antonio .

"Subject: re : var for credit trading
ted
thanks for the note - coming from jpmorgan i understand the importance of var
as a key control measure and i appreciate that we may all need to do further
work to ' institutionalise ' a var culture in enron . however , in this instance ,
i believe the initial comment has been taken out of context .
i believe there is a general communication issue here . since inception the
business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity
measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as dvolon the daily dpr .
however , no - one in rac / commercial / commercial support appears to have formally
equated that sensitivity to the business var limit during the longer than
expected delay to the completion of a signed off var model . ( informally this
is being done )
i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly
necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit
spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling
factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately .
finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading
are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting
- we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible .
i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface
issues with you next week

subject : re : var for credit trading
please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails .
the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to
adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to .
it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a
product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally
appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance
of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable .
obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it
lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that
airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the
point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to
europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var
as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any
progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one
at a time .

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

i don ' t yet have a specific job nailed down for him . i think that he could run a urm desk ( east or west ) . he could run the site profile , asset profile , dsm group . i would expect that he would expect to come in at a vp level . i know that ' s a high bar and hard to do here , which is why i would want this group of people to meet with him . i have asked debra davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews .

hey , here is another wonderful group of facts about women . i don ' t
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance . even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom .
did you know that it ' s beautiful women month ? well , it is and that means
you .
there are 3 billion women who don ' t look like supermodels . . . and only
eight who do . marilyn monroe wore a size 14 . if barbie was a real woman ,
she ' d have to walk on all fours due to her proportions . the average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9 - 14 . one out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder . the models in the magazines are airbrushed - -
not perfect !
a psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70 % of women to feel depressed , guilty , and
shameful . models twenty years ago weighed 8 % less than the average woman .
today they weigh 23 % less .
* * * * *
beauty of a woman -
the beauty of a woman
is not in the clothes she wears ,
the figure she carries
or the way she combs her hair .
the beauty of a woman
must be seen from her eyes ,
because that is the doorway to her heart ,
the place where love resides .
the beauty of a woman
is not in a facial mole ,
but true beauty in a woman
is reflected in her soul .
it is the caring that she lovingly gives
the passion that she shows ,
the beauty of a woman
with passing years - only grows .

following our conversation this morning i just want to confirm what we
have agreed .
pat - please can you read through the points below and send stuart an
e - mail confirming that you agree with everything , particularly the
' conditions ' section , and that all the ubs warburg energy staff will
comply with the conditions as laid out below .
decisions :
= = = = = = =
1 ) the brand name for the new trading entity that we are acquiring from
enron will be ubs warburg energy .
2 ) the domain name will be www . ubswenergy . com and we will also point ,
but not market , various other domain names to the site , eg
www . ubsenergy . com , www . ubswarburgenergy . com
3 ) the new entity will follow all ubs warburg corporate identity rules
in terms of font , imagery and colour usage for all printed and online
material .
conditions :
= = = = = = = =
1 ) that in 6 months ' time ( week beginning 29 july 2002 ) our position is
reviewed . if this venture is successful and we plan to continue with
it , the branding position will change and the entity will be fully
incorporated into ubs warburg and any changes necessary with regard to
branding will be made .
2 ) the domain name will change , will follow corporate guidelines and
will follow the format of www . ubswarburg . com / energy ( where the
' / energy ' part can be discussed in order to ensure the most appropriate
name is used .
3 ) all printed material will be changed to reflect the change in brand
which therefore means that any material produced immediately will have
a relatively short shelf - life as it may have to be re - printed .

subject : new copier information for 55 , 60 & 65 cpm digital machines
shirley ,
following up on the telephone conversation , please see the attached
spreadsheet for pricing information plus important information about "" true
world "" copy speeds .
pricing was centered on the 42 . 315 k per month volume band so that you can get
a good feel for copier expenditure based on average month volumes . i have
left the spreadsheet "" unprotected "" so that you can play with the volume
figures and see how this changes the price overall + how the "" cost per image ""
is affected by volume changes .
? pricing spreadsheet : under "" notes "" towards under the pictures .
the "" true world "" copy speed information has been supplied by buyers lab
incorporated , which is an independent testing house that rates office
equipment , including copiers and publishes their findings on a quarterly
basis . unfortunately they have not released their findings on the canon ir 550
as testing is not yet complete .
? copier speeds : @ the end of the notes - mail
{ these include 1 - 1 , 1 - 2 and duplexing + detail on completion of "" sets "" }
as you will see , duplexing speeds are widely different across the various
manufacturers equipment & the "" true world "" copy speeds are a soft $ expense
which impacts the true cost of running a copier .

enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course . i think that they would be interested if they got a good discount .

we just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the
weather derivatives course ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily , and thus thought it
may be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
large ? side ) ? we would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as well , but thought you may want to save some time .
i just wanted to give you some time to think about it . we will know ? where
we stand on final numbers by next wednesday .

"Subject: re : dun & bradstreet info for credit trading
thank you for keeping us in the loop on this . d & b data will become one of
our most important sources . as you suggest , the intent is to use this data
along with other available date to generate a price for credit . the price
will be published externally ( likely for a fee and as a free service ) via the
web or via automated processes .
option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to
date data as possible . stuart is working with the credit team to define
additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely
what we are looking for . alternatively , if it is possible to obtain the
actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to
generate our own score in addition to d & b ' s . we will need the global failure
score as well . currently we are active in europe as well as the us and
expect to move towards asia and austrailia over time . hopefully , this data
is available via d & b connect .
another consideration is the term of contract . we would likely prefer a
longer term contract so that if they decide they don ' t like what we are doing
with the data , we cannot be cut off . does it make sense from your
perspective to approach d & b to be our long term , strategic providor of
customer data . this would likely make their deal maker look good in his
boss ' s eyes , give you lot ' s of negotiating ability and give a us the long
term preferential contract that we are looking for .
let ' s discuss further .

subject : dun & bradstreet info for credit trading
i have received preliminary information from d & b . i think several
issues / questions have been raised that if explored , could result in a better
solution for the money .
option 1
the update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to
monthly for a cost of $ 87 , 000 ( usd ) through march , 2001 .
option 2
i wasn ' t sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in . if
you are particularly interested in the financial stress score and credit
score , for example , there are multiple alternatives :
2 a ) keep quartlery refresh of base data ( party name , etc ) and refresh scores
that are added / changed on a monthly basis . cost - $ 1 . 17 ( usd ) per
record . note that there are 575 , 000 records in the file currently
with financial and credit scores , making this potentially a very expensive
alternative
( 575 , 000 x 1 . 17 = $ 672 , 750 ) .
2 b ) batch or ftp updates of the financial and stress scores can only be
provided monthly . d & b is working on a solution that would provide a
weekly update to their customers in a batch or ftp manner , but has
not committed to when this will be ready . therefore , if more timely updates
than monthly are desired , it is also possible to
transactionally access records one at a time using d & b ' s software . the cost
for this is extremely high at $ 10 . 52 ( usd ) per score .
option 3
d & b connect product .
d & b connect is a tool set of matching software , an externally validated
reference file , credit and marketing information , and d & b services that
enables the most effective integration of customer information and
third - party information with d & b information . only this type of process and
information integration capability can facilitate and ensure accurate
identification , linkage and maintenance of your customer ' s complete
relationship . in addition , d & b connect assures organizations of
referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to d & b so
that the most recent d & b information is always transmitted to your
organization and updated within your local d & b connect reference file . d & b
connect is scalable .
cost typically ranging from
* customer access module ( cam ) batch - - $ 25 , 000
* cam online - $ 50 , 000
* full information integrator - $ 350 , 000 + data
with more specifics as to your needs , this option should perhaps be pursued .
questions / issues
1 ) d & b had questions regarding the use of their data and whether enron
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free . i explained
that i did not feel the data would be offered directly to enron customers ,
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available
externally via web site , etc . all pricing above is based upon this
understanding . if i have not portrayed the usage correctly , it will be
imperative to get a better understanding before final pricing can be
negotiated .
2 ) are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?
alternatives may vary by data element . financial stress score and credit
score reference above were explored as an example .
3 ) what is timeframe for needing a solution ?
4 ) financial stress score and credit score are only available on u . s .
companies . a comparable measure - global failure score ( the liklihood of
default or bankruptcy ) is available for international companies . this
rating score however , is not currently available via a batch or ftp manner .
this could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this
score in a batch manner .
5 ) pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes . this is
probably negotiable as the data is the same . the thought process is that if
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions , d & b will see decreased
usage and revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments .

state fights 6 , 000 firms ' energy deals
discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers

thousands of california businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last - minute contracts with private power suppliers .
more than 6 , 000 firms , including big retail chains and industrial plants , signed discounted power contracts in july and august as market prices dropped .
state officials are incensed , saying the private "" direct access "" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses .
state treasurer phil angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for california .
"" i think it ' s wrong and it ' s immoral , "" angelides said .
state officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because california businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state public utilities commission . the puc is set to consider the retroactive ban thursday . but energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the puc had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday .
"" the drafts were not consistent , "" said tracy fairchild , a spokeswoman for alliance for retail energy markets , a consortium of generators and energy suppliers . "" which one were we supposed to take seriously ? ""
the energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts . angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $ 12 . 5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for california ' s emergency power purchases .
the burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access - - a core provision of the state ' s 1996 deregulation law .
deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers . but the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power .
to make sure the state ' s outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers , the legislature in january directed the puc to suspend direct access . by that time ,
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices .
the puc postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions .
but by july , market prices had come down , and energy providers like enron energy services , aes new energy and strategic energy were again offering direct access contracts .
businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in june , said phoenix energy consultant gina coleman . coleman said she helped five retail chains with "" a significant number "" of stores in california negotiate contracts with strategic energy this summer .
"" business is business , and if you can get a better price for something , you should , "" said coleman , who declined to name her clients . she said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in california and hold their prices down .
daniel douglass , an attorney for the alliance for retail energy markets , said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law . he said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled .
angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state ' s long - term power contracts .
"" you can ' t take advantage of the state ' s stabilizing the rates , then say , ' thank you very much , ' and stick everyone else with the bill , "" angelides said .
state officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in july and august , nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers .
figures compiled by the puc show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6 , 000 new direct access contracts in july alone . a rough calculation suggests that , as a result , the firms might contribute as much as $ 64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs .
the loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale , state officials said .
bu angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education , health care and children ' s services .
"" what they ' re talking about doing , "" he said , "" is holding us hostage until they get what they want . ""

dear vince , jim , george , david and vasant :
neil doherty , paul kleindorfer and i very much enjoyed our discussion last
wednesday at wharton with you on future joint research with enron over the
coming year . in particular , we see the whole area of capital management and
catastrophic risk as a fruitful area for foint collaboration . i am sharing
this message with louis thomas and keith weigelt who direct the fap mba
program in the hopes that we can find a team to work with us on these issues
next semester .
attached is a revised version of our paper on "" evaluating risk bearing ,
mitigation and risk transfer using exceedance probability curves : project
update "" . we would greatly appreciate you and your colleagues looking at the
section on "" cat bonds covering multiple risks "" ( pp . 15 - 19 ) to see whether our
example and conclusions make sense to you . we look forward to working with
your team at enron regarding ways that we can build on these preliminary
findings to make cat bonds for weather risks more attractive .
best wishes for the holiday .

sally , fyi - we ' ve had many complaints and i ' ve had many discussions today
with dave n . and inja . they did discover some system board that is going to
be replaced tonight . hopefully replacing the board will do it but history
makes me skeptical that this is the sole cause for the slow performance .
needless to say we had to get settlements and volume management to stop their
work and we still didn ' t see any improvement . i know everyone is just as
frustrated as logistics . at our last several meetings to discuss this problem
i was insistent that unless they have an answer it seems to me , and the rest
of the staff , that the system just cannot support the real heavy demand that
first of month noms and the monthly close require .
i ' ve included an email i received from kathy kelly if you want some gory

nominations on the largest pipes today some have taken as long as 55
minutes .

bob ,
you have probably already caught wind of this since it seems to be the only
thing anyone is talking about today , but i wanted to bring it to your
attention that unify is at an all time pathetic slowness today . basically ,
this is all i ' ve heard about today from the schedulers . clarissa has just
handed me a screen print that shows that it took 33 . 23 minutes to create a
nom on tennessee . robert has informed me that it has taken him 55 minutes to
create a nom on columbia gas . it took me over 30 minutes to log on today and
as soon as i ran a report , it kicked me out saying that i didn ' t have enough
memory .
this has always been a problem at the end of the month , but this month has
reached in all time low . i ' ve talked to dave about three or four times today
and so has ed . ed has been monitoring the system and he seems to think that
client services has been taking a large part of the cpu time . we have both
questioned dave on this , but he doesn ' t seem to see anything unusual with the
amount of users from accounting , although he does agree that a huge amount of
cpu time is being used .
i hate to end this on a negative note , but at this rate , no one will be
clean by 1 : 45 tomorrow . i don ' t know what the status is as far as people
looking into ways to make unify faster , but maybe it is time to draw some
attention to this again .
by the way , the bridge from sitara to unify has also been crawling today .
i ' ve already informed dave of this , but the bridge was totally out of
commission this past weekend as well . this effected those people who tried
to get a jump start on cleaning for the month and working on the first of the
month noms . i hate to say it , but once again , how can we expect people to
get their work done , if we don ' t give them systems that work . on a good
note , i did get feedback from clarissa that terminal server was working well
over the weekend . unfortunately , she said that unify was terribly slow , but
no slower than it is when she ' s here in the office .",0

you are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled : "" acquiring
information : trade secrets and the economic espionage act ( eea ) "" . daniel
waltz , of the law firm patton boggs llp , is a leading expert on the eea and
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment .
congress passed the eea in 1996 , and it will increasingly shape how corporate
america collects , uses , and protects valued information . in addition to
explaining some of the intricacies of the eea , dan waltz will include
"" hypothetical "" corporate case studies ( some actually torn from the headlines )
to illustrate his points .
this event is sponsored by ena ' s competitive analysis and business controls
( cabc ) group and is supported by ena legal . this event kicks - off cabc ' s
competitive intelligence standards program , which seeks to raise awareness of
issues relevant both to enron ' s practitioners and senior consumers of
competitive intelligence . this particular speaking engagement is designed to
raise awareness of the eea ' s legal guidelines , as well as to stimulate
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well
as how we might better protect enron ' s own proprietary information . i
believe the topic of the eea is especially relevant , given that we find
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age .
all cabc staff is being asked to attend this presentation , and we are
inviting a small number of other enron employees who are engaged in aspects
of serious competitive intelligence . select executives like yourselves are
being invited to attend , and i would welcome any suggestions of others that
you think might benefit from attending this event .
the eea presentation is set for august 15 , 1 : 30 - 3 : 00 pm , in the 50 th floor
conference room . please rsvp to either myself or sharon purswell . hope to
see you there .
p . s . by the way , our next speaker segment in the ci standards program will
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the "" foreign corrupt
practices act ( fcpa ) , "" and will likely be scheduled for the fall .",0

discussions for the new working group , it might not be the ideal venue
for enron to get acquainted with caida . vince and stinson may want to
wait until kc claffy or i can visit portland , or have several enron
reps visit san diego for demos and related discussions .
we have been talking to stan hanks for some time about enron ' s
interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing
some of the performance features in coralreef that he has described as
relevant to enron . examples of existing coralreef analyses on oc 3 / 12
links can be found at :
( real - time )
https : / / anala . caida . org / aix /
( post - processed traces )
we are also working to better tune the skitter tool for reachability
analysis and for use by providers , an example of some existing
analyses can be found at
for end - to - end measurements , including those relating to service level
guarantees , we are working to make skping and sktrace more useful to
providers and their noc personnel , see
another tool of relevance to providers is our cflowd which analyzes
flow export data from cisco routers , see
http : / / www . caida . org / tools / cflowd / .
we would appreciate the opportunity to talk with enron personnel about
how to make these tools more relevant and useful to your needs ,
however , it is doubtful that we will have time to discuss specific
tools on thursday .
we look forward to meeting you soon !

b . wg charters , meeting on 2 mar 00
i believe that we should instead run a single caida working group
on ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier . my draft
of its charter is appended below . it focuses on producing educational
material about network measurement , and on developing new metrics - these
were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members .
the wg co - chairs are
sue moon ( sprintlabs ) and brett watson ( mfn / abovenet )
you are invited to attend the first wg meeting .
the agenda is as follows . .

10 am - 4 pm , abovenet , downtown sjc ( see below for details )
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1 . review wg charter
- is it reasonable as set out in the draft ?
- what should be removed or added ?
2 . work through revised charter in detail
- identify the work required for each part
- determine who ' s willing to work on it
- attempt to determine delivery times
3 . discussion of new metrics
- first attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered
4 . anything else ?

used by isps in engineering and operating their networks ?
by customers for verifying service guarantees ?
b . what new services are being ( or are likely to be ) offered , e . g .
diffserv ? is there a need for higher - layer metrics to better
monitor and manage these services ?
c . will these new differentiated transport - and
application - layer services need new metrics ?
d . how can the service metrics be measured in a multi - isp
environment ?
e . how can customers verify these measurements ?
f . what requirements would service measurement introduce for

requirements ?
h . how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived
by users ? how do they correlate with performance ?
appendix b : background on the ietf working groups
* rtfm wg : realtime traffic flow measurement
rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two - way traffic flows ,
specified in terms of their end - point attributes . its primary goal was
to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the
following needs :
a . wider range of measurable quantities , e . g . those
relating to ipv 6 , and to class of service
b . simpler ways to specify flows of interest
c . better ways to control access to measured flow data
d . strong focus on data reduction capabilities
e . efficient hardware implementation
* ippm wg : ip performance measurement
the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can
be applied to the quality , performance , and reliability of internet
data delivery services . these metrics will be designed such that they
can be performed by network operators , end users , or independent
testing groups . it is important that the metrics not represent a value
judgement ( i . e . define "" good "" and "" bad "" ) , but rather provide unbiased
quantitative measures of performance .
rfcs
framework for ip performance metrics ( rfc 2330 )
metrics :
connectivity ( rfc 2678 ) ,
one - way delay ( rfc 2679 ) , one - way packet loss ( rfc 2680 )
round - trip delay ( rfc 2681 )
i - ds
bulk transfer capacity ( 2 x )
instantaneous packet delay variation
one - way loss patterns
* other wgs
the rmonmib wg is thinking about ' application performance
measurement . ' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just
mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how
should the measurements be presented , etc . ) .
in short
- rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic
volumes
- ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the
current , best - effort internet .
- rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement

subject : trip to london next week
brent price and i will be in the london office next week , arriving monday
morning and returning to houston on friday . the purpose of my visit is in
regard to my global risk management operations role , i believe that rick
causey met with you regarding some operations support that brent and i will
provide to fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during
the assimilation of michael jordan , the jp morgan staffer that fernley has
hired . brent and i will be working with fernley next week to iron out the
details of our support for fernley during that transition period . we will
also map out an enron trading operations introduction for michael jordan ,
which may involve a short stint for him in houston . my goal is to provide a
strong resource to fernley during this transition period and to work with
fernley to provide whatever assistance , training , and orientation to michael
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as
possible .
another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with fernley and his
business controllers to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we
would commit to for 2000 . i know that barry and richard sage have many good
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all enron
locations with trading operations . my earlier trips to london this year were
focused solely on helsinki , and did not allow time to positively focus on
leveraging worldwide operations experience . i value input from other trading
operations professionals and i look forward to the ideas that can be
generated in working with barry , richard and some of their direct reports .
i also contacted tani nath about my trip to see how i could support her as
she moves into her role in global products . i have not heard from tani , but
i understand from others that she will be in the houston office next week .
it will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip , but based on my commitments in
houston and rick causey ' s desire to move forward on providing trading
operations support to fernley , next week is the best for me to be in london .
i did meet with tani for an hour when she was here week before last and
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role
over global products . i trust that she will contact me for that support as
needed .
i have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while i am there to
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your
business efforts in london . i look forward to meeting with you next week .
this trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations / control review that we are
conducting at joe sutton ' s request . by circumstance , as you know , we have
taken a look at helsinki and subsequently oslo and frankfurt . there will be
a similar review of continental power , uk gas , uk power and global liquids .
the review teams are currently focused on operations / controls reviews of
north american locations and some entities in the us in which enron has a
large ownership position . it is likely that the continuation of this effort
in london will occur in mid april .
copies of the drafts of the findings for oslo and frankfurt were provided to
fernley as soon as the team returned to houston . we hope to finalise those
drafts this week as we receive comments from fernley and the business
managers in oslo and frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided . fernley
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final
copies , so i will have those forwarded to you today . the sydney and
singapore trip was a lengthy one , as it also involved a last leg of the trip
in london with regard to support for singapore . the houston team returned
the middle of last week and worked with aa on an early draft last friday . i
can also provide you with a draft of that report , the completion of which was
pending input from bill bradford early this week ( he made the trip but was
out of the office last week ) . we did do a preliminary review of the sydney
and singapore findings with rick causey and rick buy on friday afternoon , to
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week . they
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them .",0

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .

in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

hi randy , bill .
as per our discussion this afternoon randy ,
enron corp . ( enron ) has deteriorated further in the market place and the
recent downgrade of enron by s & p to bbb , although not completely a surprise ,
is still disconcerting . i applaud enron ' s effort in obtaining additional
bank lines to shore up liquidity but am disappointed that your pipeline
assets had to be pledge in support of same . additionally , moody ' s and s & p
have stated publicly that further downgrade is possible .
i would like to remind you that ngx does not provide any unsecured lines to
entities who are rated below bbb .
as you well know , given ngx ' s size and the fact that ngx needs to keep the
integrity of the exchange intact , we have no option but to inform you of the
following .
accordingly , please be advised that effective immediately enron canada corp
( ecc ) will no longer have any unsecured lines here at ngx ( reference
attached contracting party ' s agreement , schedule c , para 3 . 0 . a ) .
we respectfully request that ecc provide collateral ( preferably irrevocable
letter of credit , else registered interest in cash ) by the close of business
day monday , november 5 , 2001 ( reference contracting party ' s agreement ,
schedule c , para 8 . 1 ) .
as i said , if some other counterparty was in the position you are in right

"Subject: enron net works
it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business

dennis ,
i do not have anything documented in any detail yet . lindyis out on vacation & i lknow i will be reviewing the requirments with her . i will be working on the flow direction requirements over the next 2 to 3 maybe 4 weeks . after discussing with hasan , we plan to implement in the december / january time frame so that it moves in with tw ' s new contract system . this flow direction project was part of the tw 2001 system enhancement budget dollars . i know that at the cms status update meeting last week lisa noted these two items for tw . also noted was a comment about needing the details on the winthin and outside the path . the within and outside the path is already coded in the current cbs system and ple system . you should be able to pull from the current system the process . i know it will need to merge into the new system . the basic concept is as follows :
all points on tw are tied to a marketing lateral code .
this code is stored in ple for each point on tw
a batch process is set up in cbs that is a stored procedure that runs everyday at 12 : 00 noon to calculate the inside / outside the paths on all firm contracts . ( release , fts 3 , ftsl , lft , efbh ) . this process finds the marketing lateral for the primary receipt and primary delivery pionts & identifies all possible laterals between the primary receipt to primary delivery that can be valid alternate points inside the path and stores those to be used in the allocation process . it maps it out for each firm contract . this process is uses the valid marketing laterals to build the inside alternate paths . any contract whose alternate receipt or alternate delvery point that is not in the valid available marketing lateral is an outside the path transaction . tms uses this process in the allocations on tw .
with revalidation the tms system checks for contracts that change primary receipt points and delivery points in the evening , nongrid , i / dl , and i / d 2 cycles . however the stored procedure batch job is a maunal process , the contract team would submit this batch job on demand so that it can identify the valid marketing laterals for that specific contract that was changed . i would like to see this automated with the new cms system . each time a firm contract is changed for a gas day after the timely cycle is run , this batch job or stored procedure should automaticly rum again for that contract that was changed .
thanks ramona

* * * about the company * * *
advanced powerline technologies is engaged in the broadband over
powerline
industry . their business is based on the idea of using existing power
lines , both in the home and outside , to transmit information . this
information includes broadband internet and the development of "" the
21 st
century home "" concept in which home appliances and computers are
networked .
apwl and others in the industry have exciting plans to turn
pre - existing
electrical infrastructure into big business . apwl has been engaged in
the
industry for many years and have been awarded numerous applicable
patents .
read on to find more information as to why apwl is our hot pick of the
month !
* * * news from the industry * * *
new millennium research council ( nmrc ) has recently released a report
in
which they say :
"" many industry watchers and representatives now believe bpl ( broadband
over
power lines ) can dramatically change the landscape of the broadband
market ,
offering new forms of competition and delivering high - quality service
to
remote
areas . ""
"" is 2005 the year of bpl ? there are a number of signs that suggest this
could be the time the
technology begins its emergence as a viable competitor in the broadband
market . ""
"" during the past two years , the commercial and media perspectives on
bpl in
the united states have
evolved from categorizing the technology as  almost ready ¶ to  really
here . ¶
"" current research into the bpl industry indicates a belief among some
experts that the industry may
be primed for real growth in 2005 and beyond . ""
( cnet news ) - february 24 , 2004 - earlier this month , the federal
communications commission proposed rules for utility companies that
seek to
offer internet access through their electricity grids . the fcc hopes
its
rules for broadband over power line ( bpl ) will help jump - start the use
of
the grid network to deliver high - speed net access to u . s . households ,
especially in hard - to - reach rural areas .
( idg news service ) - april 10 , 2005 - the european union ' s communications
regulator , the european commission , launched an initiative on friday to
boost the growth of broadband internet access over power transmission
lines .
the news on this sector is everywhere . 2005 is the year for advanced
powerline technologies .
* * * top reasons to consider apwl * * *
* advanced powerline technologies is poised at the pinnacle of the most
modern technology since the development of cable fiber optics .
* advanced powerline technologies has fathered a quantum leap forward
in
advanced cable free high - resolution video .
* apt ' s technology significantly reduces many of the expensive cable
placements now necessary to bring audio / video and high speed internet
to the
end user .
* apt is engaged in acquiring contracts to provide their technology to
countries and regions where power lines are the norm but in which
internet
over telephone lines has not , or can not reach the market .
the time to act is now . news is out for apwl . the sector is ready to
explode onto the scene . the road is paved for big returns on
investment .

dear , sir / madam .
we want to transfer to overseas the sum of forty two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 42 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank here in africa .
i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .
my name is mr . greg louis i am an external auditor of a local bank here in south africa . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a  $ be )  ( beir apparent to the throne  $ bgi  ( bence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing .
the owner of this account who is mr . hugo williams , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1990 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that hugo williams until his death was the managerceylinco diamond company , in south africa .
the total amount involved is forty two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 42 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign  $ be ""  ( bgreement  $ b ! &  ( b but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . hugo williams is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account .
however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards . as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments .
i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down .
with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing .
to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services .
at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .
i look forward to your earliest reply through mye - mail address or tel / fax .
yours truly
greg louis .

subject : re : eletrobolt
john :
we still do not have a deal with the government . they have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks . the latest is that they have said that they will give us something on tuesday of next week .
with respect to the burn rate , we are projecting about $ 20 million in expenditures over the next month . our current investment is about $ 220 million .
i think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months . the investment is currently funded through an off - balance sheet / on - credit vehicle with westlb . the westlb vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations . the plan is to have the opic financing in place to take out the westlb vehicle . this would infer an approximate $ 95 million equity investment upon the take - out of the westlb vehicle . we are currently in the process of syndicating the equity . we have one indicative proposal for 50 % of the equity . we hope to have another next week .
there are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of . westlb did not want to take operating risk in the financing . our position with westlb is that we do not reach commercial operations until we reach the start date of the petrobras contract . we are currently producing energy into the grid . at some point , westlb could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the opic funding . depending upon the timing , this could represent a cash flow of up to $ 280 million for a short period of time .
please let me know what other questions you have .

subject : investments meeting agenda
john , wes and michael ,
the purpose of tomorrow ' s meeting is to discuss a few of the investments that we are planning on transferring to the new investment group . the specific issues are as follows :
? encorp - the value of this investment was written up from $ 3 million to $ 9 . 85 million in q 4 2000 without justification . it should be written back down at the end of this quarter . otherwise , we are going to have a bigger problem later .
? dais analytic - same issue as above . investment was written up from $ 8 million to $ 20 million . it should be written back down this quarter .
? amps - this is a problem . this company is going to continue to need capital ( an additional $ 7 million immediately ) well beyond what enron should be funding . i am not willing to provide this company with ongoing funding without significant further evaluation . if it is that important to the strategic effort of ena , then i recommend that ena continue to manage the company and provide financing .
? bridgeline - after further evaluation , it is clear that this is not a merchant investment and should not be moved to my group . i spoke with jeff donahue , and we both agree that if you want it sold , then his team should be the right one to do it .
? copel - this one is fuzzy , but jeff donahue and i have agreed that one of us should take responsibility for exiting this investment . we still need to figure this one out .

i agree that it makes sense to put the ll in place . there are several things

whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and / or managing a

description , just let me know and i will be happy to contact him / her .

infinity showed a $ 19 mm notional curve shift change in the ei - gns - gas - prc
commodity book for 9 / 1 / 00 . this change caused a ( 10 , 200 ) pvol affect on the
trader ' s sensitivity report . after talking with susan in ei , it was brought
to our attention that the bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on friday ,
due to a change in ei ' s curve upload process . this change resulted in the
bolivian curve loading throughout 2012 , when it actually goes out to 2019 .
the incomplete curve caused infinity to get bad cash flows .
as a result , we had to re - do pdh reports this morning . final reports were
given to traders at 9 : 00 am .

"Subject: i found something !
finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !
check it out

"Subject: recruiting and floor buildout
during the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor build out given the state of the company today . we appreciate people ' s concerns about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be reducing unnecessary expenses . let us begin by saying that we share these concerns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditures without a great deal of thought . we would also encourage people to talk to their manager or either of us if you don ' t understand why we are doing certain things . in short , we have decided to continue with the college recruiting , although we have not yet decided how many , if any , we will hire . we have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple of weeks .
why are we continuing with college recruiting ?
during the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a presence for enron broadly and the portland office specifically with leading schools in the northwest . this past year we finally reached critical mass and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts . although we are uncertain about our hiring needs this year , we feel that it is in our best long term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the northwest . we have already made presentations and done initial screenings at most schools . we have identified the best people from each school and have already made plans for them to come to our office for two super saturdays . the cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as participants in their on - campus recruiting programs . we also realize that it is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job . it is our belief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities of employment may be somewhat diminished . finally , we would like to emphasize the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody . we will interview people , identify the best candidates , and make hiring decisions based on the needs of the office . before extending offers we will consider the potential impact that it could have on people in this office and enron employees in other offices who have been redeployed . stated another way , we don ' t intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within enron who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people already here at risk . we may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are more certain about the state of affairs in the company .
how will the floor move play out ?
we have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks . while we still think that it makes sense for the office , we have decided to pause for a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money on this . when talking to the build out team today it became clear that delaying would accomplish several goals . first , it allows us to get final architectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can more precisely peg down the costs before moving forward . second , it gives the build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move . finally , it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right now . while we still think that we are going to move forward with this project , it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do right now . in about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team with firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead , cancel , or delay again .
as always , we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new , reliable information becomes available . we recognize that this is a very hard time for everyone . please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep up the success of this office .

"Subject: ose puts the blame where it belongs by pointing out that the iso ' s favoritism towards dwr cost california billions in potential refunds .
iso ' s role in sales is rapped : critics challenge the independence of the power grid operator .
by david whitney
bee washington bureau
( published aug . 3 , 2001 )
washington - - the independence of california ' s power transmission grid operator and its electricity sales to the state department of water resources came under fire at a house of representatives hearing thursday .
but grid operators said there was no way that arms - length transactions with the department of water resources could have been negotiated beginning in january when power blackouts were imminent and the state was the only buyer with money .
rep . doug ose , r - sacramento , chairman of the house governmental affairs energy policy panel , charged in a prepared statement to open the hearing that the cozy relationship between the dwr and the california independent system operator could result in the state forfeiting any claim to refunds for overcharges by power generators .
"" the state ' s interference into cal - iso has possibly cost californians billions of dollars in potential refunds , "" ose said . "" moreover , it represents a serious violation of the federal energy regulatory commission ' s regulations . ""
at issue is the fact that the iso is run by a five - person board appointed by the governor when , under federal law , it is supposed to be independent . additionally , the iso ' s biggest customer is the dwr , which buys power using state money to firm up power deliveries by utilities too cash - starved to buy it themselves .
last week , the ferc determined that the dwr would not be entitled to any rate refunds on its power contracts . in reaching that decision , the commission cited the agency ' s special access to information that gave it a competitive advantage over other purchasers .
terry m . winter , iso president and chief executive officer , said that at the time the department of water resources began buying power in january under these unusual circumstances , there were no other buyers willing to step in to keep power flowing to homes and businesses .
"" that occurred because the market was not functioning , "" winter said . "" they were the only creditworthy purchaser purchasing power . ""
but kevin madden , the regulatory commission ' s top lawyer , said the relationship between the iso and the department of water resources raises troubling questions .
"" dwr buying on behalf of the state is a market participant , "" he said . "" it shouldn ' t be in the iso control room . it shouldn ' t be allowed to cherry pick "" among power sellers .
madden said he expects the commission to rule soon on whether the iso should be reconstituted to ensure its independence .

el paso field services - epfs has agreed to go forward on a new interconnect
with tw in eddy county , nm . the size of the new interconnect will be 40 , 000
mmbtu / d . epfs has agreed to pay $ 165 , 000 towards the cost estimate of
$ 280 , 000 as well as commit 12 , 500 mmbtu / d throughput for a period of 2
years . facility planning is opening a new work order and we have begun
drafting the interconnect agreement and the oba for the new point . the point
should be active in 60 - 90 days .
arizona public service - has still not signed the transport request for the
14 , 000 mmbtu / d april - october 2001 capacity . the current spread is $ 0 . 375 -
$ 0 . 40 .
red cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5
year agreement . contract documentation is being prepared .
sempra - has again exercised their option under their gallup contract for
21 , 500 mmbtu / d permian to california for 1 year starting 11 / 1 / 01 . the
contract rate is $ 0 . 30 plus fuel .
texaco is moving up to 100 , 000 mmbtu / d from pg & e topock to mojave starting
8 / 21 through 10 / 31 / 00 . tw collected an incremental $ . 025 / mmbtu for this move
or approximately $ 160 , 000 .
el paso outage -
current reports are the office of pipeline safety is demanding el paso hydro
test , x - ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out
of service due to last weekend ' s explosion . it appears the 1 bcf / d capacity
to california may be off - line for up to one month .
related developments
- - socal released capacity on el paso for october 2000 to dynegy at a
reservation charge of $ 1 . 00 / mmbtu .
- - volume on various tw interconnect points has picked up on the east end
including the new ngpl winkler point .
- - we are receiving incremental volume from el paso at window rock and
collecting a portion of the market premium .
transport options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled
for thursday august 31 . the objective will be to get everyone comfortable
and build a coalition of support behind our new options tariff filing .
burlington resources - we held a conference call with john hinton , marketing
director , regarding the current operation of the val verde plant . our data
indicates with the exception of a few t - 5 temperature limit days , tw has been
able to accept over 98 % of the gas nominated by the plant . in addition , for
the last 2 years , the plant has been delivering gas with co 2 in excess of our
specs . we agreed our latest amendment draft could use some stronger language
in terms of tw ' s obligations beyond a "" best efforts "" basis . john indicated
a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of
215 , 000 mmbtu to us for hub delivery . we agreed to talk again next week
once the volume test was complete .
socal windowing - a conference call was held with mike nelson , rich jolly ,
steve january , terry galassini , darrell schoolcraft , ray smith , gary choquet ,
and david roentsch regarding tw ' s pressures and delivery capability at socal
needles . analysis indicates we have 35 pounds of pressure drop from our
needles measurement station to the socal station across the river
( approximately two miles ) . socal maintains that if we can give them 830 psi
at their station , they can take the full 750 , 000 mmbtu under the contract
( this translates to 870 psi at tw ' s meter with our current situation ) . our
problem has been if we lose volume out of san juan or a unit on the west of
thoreau leg , then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border . socal
acknowledges they have a motor out of service at needles but plan to have it
back on line in october . but they maintain this won ' t help resolve the
situation . operations has agreed to look at a number of things including
changing the type of meter at needles , looking at some station valve
replacement , and mechanical condition of stations 1 through 4 . marketing
agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume
delivery to help justify any capital expenditures .",0

greetings .
as you may recall , i am the director of the univ . of texas center for
energy finance ( cefer ) . i would like at this time to initiate planning for
your colleague vince kaminski ' s annual presentation to the ut foundations
of energy finance class which i will be presenting as usual the first half
of the fall semester .
thus , to begin , i wonder whether either the above is your current e - mail
account , and , with the departure of meryl barnett ( with whom i believe we
coordinated this in the past ) , whether this is an issue within your scope .
with respect to this reception , i appreciate that there may be other enron
receptions scheduled for this fall . however , if you so choose , i would
like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an enron reception
following vince ' s presentation . if you would indeed like to do so , i
suggest we coordinate with vince the date for the presentation / reception .

subject : credit applicatiions in grms
this note is from ted murphy ( not bjorn hagelman )
my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the
intent
of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project .
while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project , i do know that we
have a very large , multi - phase project going in grms .
grms stands for the global risk monitoring system . it is not intended to be a
commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial
decision - making . conceptually , it is a risk warehouse for the primary purpose
of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems and their
inability to provide timely , aggregated information useful to rac .
rac has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task
list to accomplish its objectives . as a firm we are woefully behind our press
clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile . my
most
recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current systems inabilty
to
aggregate and meet the needs of rac having abetted poor decision making and
causing cash losses in well in excess of the grms budget or that of the market
risk group in rac .
the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to do
our jobs . we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter to
make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with jonathon
and
his team as well as rick buy to provide updates . while progress is never as
fast as we would like it , in every instance in which we have only to rely on
rac , jonathon ' s team and research to make a deadline it haas been hit . the
primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of resources
off
the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source - most
recently the it staff in london was a tremendous impediment to deadlines .
please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note ,
but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening .
also , i have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration
on
the lack of management support for this project , usually manifesting itself in
the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it .
i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase
project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted . please let us
do
our jobs . i do not denigrate the efforts of others , but i believe that they
must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our consideration of
their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own project with their own
resources .
thank you for your consideration of this opinion . as it relates to things
that
will effect the ability of market risk to do its job , please consult me as i
would you .

vince ,
he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background ( and then some credit exposure calculation ) with not much credit data analysis experience . i do not think he would be appropriate for bryan ' s group - - he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data , and although this guy may be good at modeling , we already have iris and amitava doing the modeling and looking at data . at this stage , i would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis ( banking , rating agency ) . i am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience , then amitava will find himself with two people ( iris being the other one ) who are both inexperienced in this area , and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway .
if you want to pursue him , we should probably do a phone interview first .

"Subject: re : enymex
brad ,
we may consider targeting a wide audience . since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities , our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse . our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $ 31 mm ( plus option fees ) .
i have two primary documents . one is the spec sheet and a general scope . the other is a turbine purchase agreement .
a counterparty can have two options : one is to contact us to provide a bid . there would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case . their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract . for $ 1 mm , they would have a 30 day call on the turbines , during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence . the $ 1 mm buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period .
it may be a nuance , but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine . is this consistent with eol ' s format ?

the turbines idea on eol . i don ' t want to post an advetisement only i want them to post the turbines themselves . so essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product . they have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the abbs we actually have in canada . you never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non - binding as there would be site inspections etc .
but not an advert - actually posting the turbines .

alliance deliveries delayed until nov . 13
in a move that is likely to send ripples through the market , particularly
around chicago , the 1 . 325 bcf / d alliance pipeline extended its commercial
in - service delay last week to nov . 13 from oct . 30 . pipeline officials said
moisture and debris in the line caused the delay .
"" as we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system
commissioning , we have encountered moisture and debris from construction , ""
said ceo norm gish . "" specifically , most of the debris is in the form of small
pieces of foam from the [ smart ] pigs that were used to remove the hydrostatic
testing water from the line . the problem forced us to shut down the system
for short periods of time to clean out accumulated debris .
"" we have since designed and installed additional in - line screens at our
compressor stations . the situation is improving and we are removing
ever - decreasing amounts of debris with increased flows of test gas . however ,
this situation has not permitted us to run our system with the significant
volumes necessary to adequately test the reliability of our compressors . ""
it is the second time alliance has had to delay its in - service date . in early
september , alliance officials said rain in saskatchewan this summer ,
directional drilling problems at a creek in british columbia , complex
connection problems with the aux sable liquids plant in illinois and
connection delays with several u . s . pipelines and ldcs was to blame for a
one - month delay to oct . 30 ( see daily gpi , sept . 11 ) .
the pipeline will continue increasing test volumes until it begins commercial
service , said gish . there currently is about 500 mmcf / d of test gas in the
line . he expects firm delivery capacity to reach the full 1 . 325 bcf / d prior
to nov . 13 .
alliance officials also noted that this is the first time a pipeline the size
of alliance has been brought on stream at one time .
regardless of the challenge , however , market participants were expecting the
system to be delivering gas starting at the beginning of the month of
november and this delay is likely to have a significant impact on november
bidweek trading .
one chicago trader said he had a strong suspicion something was fishy when
his index offers were lifted friday afternoon by a marketing company , which
he knows to own capacity on the pipe . "" everyone was a buyer of index gas
today for november , especially those now short for the first 13 days . i sold
mine at ngi plus 1 . 5 , but had i known that alliance was delayed i would have
held out for something a little better . ""
basis , meanwhile , was pretty much unchanged at + 13 to + 14 for november . "" it
takes a lot to move the chicago basis , "" he said .",0

ken and greg ,
what we have been doing is absoutely fine under the assumption that the market
conditions move relatively small ( where taylor series has fast convergence ) .
however , we could run into troubles when the market has a big move .
in order to have a error proof bucketing , we can use the following
method ( finite - difference ) , let me
know what you guys think how to implement it to the transport book .

no significant good news .
abb :
- canada leads still alive but not making any own payments
- virgo trying to get a bid from abb for the dln combustor package and associated technology rights
- thome got a bid from new brunswick power which would net us $ 25 k per month for the winter ( nepool icap less startup and o no response yet
- allegheny / nepco : big news of the week . nepco is bidding on a project allegheny wants to do in arizona using all four mhis . we are inserting ourselves into the process to ensure that ( i ) nepco prices the turbines and the epc contract agressively ; ( ii ) allegheny understands that we can separate the turbines in case they just want to buy them . ben , brett , ron tapscott and i to meet on this today . ena / nepco / allegheny meeting tomorrow
7 fa :
- calpine finally withdrew their bid ( after we mitigated their one concern re the project - bpa transmission )
- negotiating with nrg : their verbal bid is - $ 5 mm to - $ 8 mm , but they have been slow because they just lost 2 developers / tech guys . we are offering them access to turbopark so their return on equity improves ; we are also offering up development / tech people : temporary or permanent as part of the deal ; we told them we can discount the epc contract or the equipment contracts or write them a check for the $ 5 mm discount .
- other project candidates we are working with include black hills , transalta , mirant
- we are also seeing what other sites ( in the east ) could benefit from the 7 fa train

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc
craig and kim ,
as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s
riskcalc .
you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .
well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through
today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have
information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with
riskcalc .
we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from
our colleagues in the london office .
we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us
with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .
more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following
financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :
fiscal year
the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements
are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,
such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be
a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or
2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation
is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in
general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size
affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000
makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .
cash & equivalents
this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .
inventory
inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,
without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average
cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and
supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would
include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,
insurance costs , and storage costs .
current assets
this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,
marketable securities , and other current assets .
total assets
total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .
for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total
assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment
plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,
and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for
australian companies .
current liabilities
liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are
short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .
total liabilities
this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number
representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other
noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and
minority interest ) .
retained earnings
retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative
earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .
typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less
distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low
credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank
for australian companies .
sales
this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of
actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )
reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances
for which credit is given to customers .
cost of goods sold
entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number
less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to
production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or
items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative
expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .
ebit
earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it
can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .
interest expense
this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -
and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the
prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of
computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .
net income
this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after
expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the
fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a
loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would
be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian
companies .
extraordinary items
positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes
appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as
extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and
discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses ,
income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of
accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as
positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for
australian companies .
country
this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .
we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north
american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the
evaluation of riskcalc .
thanks ,
